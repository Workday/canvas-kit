# Canvas Kit 5.0 Migration Guide

Below are the breaking changes made in Canvas Kit v5. Please reach out if you have any questions
about the update.

CSS users rejoice! :tada: No breaking changes in this release. The following changes all relate to
our React infrastructure and components.

- [General Changes](#changes)
- [Breaking Component Changes](#breaking-component-changes)
  - [Tabs](#tabs)

## General Changes

- Components are transitioning to [Compound Components](./COMPOUND_COMPONENTS.md)
  - Components will support [forwarded refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html)
  - The corresponding tag of a component can be changed with the `as` prop

## Breaking Component Changes

### Tabs

- `onTabsChange` is now `onActivateTab` and the signature is now:
  ```tsx
  function onActivateTab({data: {tab: string}, state: TabsState}): void;
  ```
- The `<Tabs>` component no longer accepts the `currentTab` property. The Tabs uses a model now. See
  story for more details
