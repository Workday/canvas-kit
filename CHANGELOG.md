## [v9.1.27](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v9.1.27) (2023-11-14)

### Components

- fix: Prevent modal from overlapping on mobile devices ([#2385](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2385)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)
## [v10.0.6](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.0.6) (2023-11-10)

### Components

- fix: Fix Style prop merging with cs prop ([#2379](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2379)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))
  This fix adds Emotion's `CacheProvider` to the `CanvasProvider`. Any application that uses the `CacheProvider` will not see this fix within the render tree of the custom `CacheProvider`.  For this fix to be applied everywhere, consider removing any use of Emotion's `CacheProvider`.
  
  Some instances of use of `CacheProvider` were to set the `compat` mode of the cache. You can now do the following instead and not use `CacheProvider` at all:
  
  ```ts
  cache.compat = true
  ```
  
  Also note this fix will break automatic server side rendering because style merging is not creating server-side only `style` tags. Since `createStyles` isn't compatible with automatic server side rendering, the merge style fix isn't compatible either. Use Emotion's solution for server-side `@emotion/css`: https://emotion.sh/docs/ssr#when-using-emotioncss
  
  The only modification is to import `cache` from `@emotion/css` instead of creating a new cache. Their documentation doesn't work:
  
  ```patch
  - import createCache from '@emotion/cache'
  - 
  - const key = 'custom'
  - const cache = createCache({ key })
  + import {cache} from '@emotion/css';
  + const {key} = cache
  ```

## [v10.0.0](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.0.0) (2023-10-25)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [#2229](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2229) There is the possibility of breaking changes if users are changing the default browser font size from `16px` to another value. 
  
  You can convert a `px` value to a `rem` value by dividing your `px` value by `16`(if your default browser font size hasn't been updated, the value will be `16`).
  
  For example:
  
  | Equation    | rem Value |
  | ----------- | --------- |
  | `16px/16px` | `1rem`    |
  | `32px/16px` | `2rem`    |
  | `8px/16px`  | `0.5rem`  |
- [#2247](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2247) To move from the Menu component in Preview to the Menu compound component in Main, please read [this discussion](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/2063).
  
  Also, see [this](https://codesandbox.io/s/deprecatedmenu-and-menu-migration-gwi1ov) codesandbox that shows the differences between DeprecatedMenu and the Menu compound component.
- [#2318](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2318) We have removed the useBanner hook, the only function of which was to add `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` references to the text inside of the Banner. This was not required for accessibility, and browsers can compute the `name` of the Banner from the text given inside.
- [#2285](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2285) - We refactored how we styled Buttons to use our `createStyles` utility function. We don't anticipate
  this as a breaking change but, there may be slight changes to visual test.
  - Icons will no longer be "filled" on toggle. This decision was made to not have the existing icon
  look different in the toggled state from default state.
  - `PrimaryButton`: On the `inverse` variant, the focus ring is now consistent with the default variant of `PrimaryButton`. This will visually change the `inverse` variant to have a larger appearance when focused. 
  - `colors` will no longer support the `focusRing` option:
    ```tsx
    import {focusRing} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';
  
    // before
    <PrimaryButton
      colors={{
        // other colors
        focus: {
          // other colors
        focusRing: focusRing(/* options */)
        }
      }}
    />
  
    // after
    <PrimaryButton
      colors={{
        // other colors
        focus: {
          // other colors
        }
      }}
      css={{
        ':focus-visible': focusRing(/* options */)
      }}
    />;
    ```
- [#2309](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2309) - We've converted `Select` in Main into a compound component. This component matches our pattern of providing access to lower-level elements and allows for more flexibility. 
  - The spacing between menu and its target element will increase from 0px to 4px
  - We've also [deprecated](https://canvas.workday.com/getting-started/canvas-glossary#deprecation) the `Select` in Preview. You may still consume this component but suggest migrating over to the one in Main.
- [#2368](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2368) The CSS kit is being removed in v10 and will come back later as derived from our React packages.

### Codemods

- feat: Set initial v10 codemod ([#2239](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2239)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))

### Components

- feat: Update space and depth tokens to rem ([#2229](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2229)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell), [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith), [@bstanton678](https://github.com/bstanton678), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))
  Updated `depth` and `space` token values to use `rem` instead of `px`.
- feat: Remove Menu Preview ([#2247](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2247)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))
  This will not involve a codemod since the API has too many differences between the component being removed in Preview and the component in Main.
- fix: Changing ARIA role to switch ([#2292](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2292)) ([@williamjstanton](https://github.com/williamjstanton), [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith))
- refactor: Removing aria attributes from Banner component ([#2318](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2318)) ([@williamjstanton](https://github.com/williamjstanton), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)
- fix: Revert removal of Menu in Preview ([#2335](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2335)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)
  We're going to continue supporting the Menu in Preview until we implement grouped menu items (with virtualization) for the Menu in Main.
- feat: Deprecate InputIconContainer ([#2332](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2332)) ([@dgubko](https://github.com/dgubko), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)
  `InputIconContainer` has been deprecated, because it does not handle bidirectionally or icons at the start of an input. Please use [`InputGroup`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/components-inputs-text-input--icons) instead.
- feat: Deprecated Table in Main ([#2344](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2344)) ([@thunguyen19](https://github.com/thunguyen19), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))
- feat: Add CSS styling function ([#2273](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2273)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))
  This change introduces an intermediate step towards static styling. The style function takes in statically analyzable style definitions with modifiers, variables, and static styles to create styling to be used in components. It can later be interpreted at build time to create CSS packages.
- chore: Refactored Button styles to use `createStyles` utility ([#2285](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2285)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))
- feat: Convert Select from Main into a compound component ([#2309](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2309)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose), [@jamesfan](https://github.com/jamesfan))
- chore: Remove CSS packages ([#2368](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2368)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))
- fix: Set a default theme in canvas provider ([#2371](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2371)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)
- chore(button): Add CSS Variable fallbacks ([#2372](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2372)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))

  We've [deprecated](https://canvas.workday.com/getting-started/canvas-glossary#deprecation) `spaceNumbers` and encourage users to use our [rem](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/) based `space` tokens.

  This fix adds additional fallback placements to prevent popups from rendering off screen. This behavior is different than before and might result in a popup rendering in an unexpected position. `fallbackPlacements` was added as a prop to `Popper` and `Popup.Popper` to allow you to override the default fallback placements (which are top/right/bottom/left in that order). This shouldn't be considered a breaking change unless your popup position needs to be restricted.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [#1970](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1970) The `Drawer` component was hard deprecated and fully removed from Canvas Kit. Please replace the deprecated `Drawer` component with `SidePanel` from the Preview package.
- [#1978](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1978) If you expected a button to submit by default, you'll have to add the attribute `type="submit"` in order to submit.
- [#2018](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2018) We have hard deprecated the Layout and Column components and they have been fully removed from our codebase in v9. We recommend using the `Grid` component as an alternative.
- [#2012](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2012) We've hard deprecated the `Stack`, `HStack` and `VStack` components. We recommend using the `Flex` component as a replacement and replacing the `spacing` prop with the `gap` prop. You can also run `npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod softDeprecate/Stack` as well.
- [#2034](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2034) - Lodash is no longer required for Canvas kit
  - memoized is removed from FocusRingOptions
- [#2044](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2044) If you're using Toast from Labs already, the package will be updated to point to `@workday/canvas-kit-react/toast`. If you're using the Toast from Main, we've replaced it with the compound Toast from labs. `v9` codemod should handle these changes for you or you can reference our v9 upgrade guide for more details.
- [#2120](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2120) - We've removed `getCanvasTheme` and `useCanvasTheme`.
  - Use `useTheme` when you have a `CanvasProvider` or you're inside of a functional component
  - Use `getTheme` when inside a styled component and you need access to theme.
- [#2180](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2180) - Removed `composeModelHooks` from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/common`
- [#2190](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2190) The type signature of `composeHooks` was changed to give more accurate return prop types. This may cause issues with Typescript if your code expected the incorrect return types.
- [#2194](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2194) The signature of the `NavigationManaget` and `NavigationRequestor` was changed to use numeric indexes instead of string identifiers. This will only break for those who created a custom navigation manager.

### Codemod

  ```tsx
  <InputIconContainer icon={<SystemIcon icon={exclamationCircleIcon} />} />
  ```

  <InputGroup>

### Dependencies

### Documentation

- docs: Revert removal of Layout section ([#2094](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2094)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))
- fix: Clean up toast documentation ([#2108](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2108)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@jamesfan](https://github.com/jamesfan))

### Infrastructure

- chore: Add initial V9 codemod ([#2021](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2021)) ([@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith), [@willklein](https://github.com/willklein))
- test: Modify visual testing ([#2028](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2028)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))
- chore: Update the TSconfig target to es2019 ([#2135](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2135)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))
  We're updating our build target from `es5` to `es2019`. This changes the syntax generated by allowing syntax supported up to `es2019`. This may impact older environments that do not support `es2019` syntax like older versions of nodejs. This could also impact older AST build parsers that don't understand newer JavasScript syntax. This could include old versions of Webpack or outdated babel parsers for Jest. If you see a message like "Syntax Error", you may have to upgrade your bundler or babel parser.
- chore: Add option to skip docgen ([#2176](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2176)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))

### Tokens

- fix: Modify depth values to improve visual design ([#2091](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2091)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)
  We've updated our `depth` tokens to be more subtle rather than harsh. Any component using these depth tokens will be updated, including `Card, Menu, Toast, Box, Dialog, Popup`.

### Utilities

- chore: Move useThemedRing to main package and deprecate useThemeRTL ([#2119](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2119)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)
  - We've promoted `useThemedRing` to our Main package.
  - We've deprecated `useThemeRTL` from our Labs package. You may still use this utility but we encourage consumers to use [CSS logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties).

- fix(collection): Correctly use custom getId ([#2096](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2096)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [#1636](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1636) Canvas Kit will require teams to be on version ^18.x or at least ^17.0 for backwards compatibility. To use have all React 18 features would require teams to upgrade root API, otherwise they will be ignored.
- [#1646](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1646) Some component will now have to be imported like this: `import { export1 } from "module-name";`

- [#1747](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1747) This update soft-deprecates all exports from `canvas-kit-labs-react/drawer`, `canvas-kit-preview-react/menu` and `Layout` and `Column` imports from `canvas-kit-react/layout`. 
  🤖 These changes are handled automatically by the codemod transform included in this PR. 
  Please refer to the v8 upgrade guide for more information.
- [#1724](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1724) - `Breadcrumbs` has been promoted and now it lives in main react package
  - `Breadcrumbs.Nav` has been removed and replaced by `Breadcrumbs`
  - `Breadcrumbs.Nav` prop of `aria-label` has been removed to `Breadcrumbs`
  - `Breadcrumbs.CollapsibleList` has been renamed to `Breadcrumbs.List`
  - `Breadcrumbs.ListItem` has been renamed to `Breadcrumbs.Item`
  
  🤖 All the above changes can be handled by running codemod
  
  ⚠️ As `onAction` has been removed from `Breadcrumbs.Item`, it requires to change manually `onAction` usage based on examples provided in the v8 upgrade guide.
  
  ⚠️ As `Breadcrumbs.CollapsibleList` has been removed, all overflow functionality provided by this component has been removed too. Now overflow functionality is provided by List system and requires to switch to `BreadcrumbsModel` manually.
- [#1785](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1785) We've removed any IE11 specific code including any polyfills. This means your application will no longer run in IE11 and fail to bootstrap with an error and a white screen. Do not upgrade to this version if your application needs to support IE11.
- [#1800](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1800) - `ComponentStatesTable`, `permutateProps`, `StaticStates` and `propTypes` have been moved to `@workday/canvas-kit-react/testing`. 
  - `StaticStates` and `convertToStaticStates` have been moved from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/common` to `@workday/canvas-kit-react/testing`

- [#1863](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1863) Optional breaking changes message. If your PR includes breaking changes. It is extremely rare to put breaking changes outside a `prerelease/major` branch. Anything in this section will show up in release notes. Remove this section if no breaking changes are present.
- [#1861](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1861) We've updated all popup `CloseIcon` and `CloseButton` to default to `type=button`. We did this so
  these close buttons did not submit the forms unintentionally. Without this change, you have to
  manually add `type="button"` to these components if you wrap popup contents in a `form` element.
  While this is a very unlikely that a `CloseButton` was intentionally used as an implicit submit
  button, it is still a breaking change. This change effects the following components:
  
  - `Popup.CloseIcon`
  - `Dialog.CloseIcon`
  - `Modal.CloseIcon`
  - `Popup.CloseButton`
  - `Dialog.CloseButton`
  - `Modal.CloseButton`
- [#1874](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1874) `ActionBar.OverflowButton` inside `ActionBar.List` is replaced with an `overflowButton` prop. So, now `ActionBar.List` with overflow behavior requires to pass an overflow button component as a `overflowButton` prop. 
  
  ```tsx
  <ActionBar.List overflowButton={<ActionBar.OverflowButton aria-label="More actions" />} />
  ```
  
  🤖 This change can be handled by using codemod.
- [#1880](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1880) The `LoadingAnimation` component has been renamed to `LoadingDots` and its slash import is now `@workday/canvas-kit-react/loading-dots` instead of `@workday/canvas-kit-react/loading-animation`.

  On smaller screen sizes (min-width of 320px to a max-width of 767px) the follow styles change on the Modal:
  - borderRadius on the `Modal.Card` has been reduced: `8px` -> `24px`

  Changes: 
  - Added requirement of `aria-label` for `nav` element in `Breadcrumbs` component.
  - Added requirement of `aria-label` for overflow button.
  - Limited overflow button render: it renders only when `overflowButtonProps` containing at least `aria-label` prop passed to `Breadcrumbs.List`.
- feat: Add `useCloseOnTargetHidden` popup hook ([#1836](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1836)) ([@stefano-puzzuoli](https://github.com/stefano-puzzuoli), [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))
  If you need a popup to close when the target element is no longer visible (useful for tooltips and dropdown menus), there's now a 'useCloseOnTargetHidden` popup hook. This will close the popup when less than 50% of the target element is visible. This hook uses an [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).
- feat: Add new compound status indicator ([#1851](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1851)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll), [@jamesfan](https://github.com/jamesfan), [@willklein](https://github.com/willklein))
  We've created a compound component version of our `StatusIndicator` which you can find under our `preview` components. This new API will allow for more composability and ergonomic API. With the new component, the default styling is to have sentenced cased text for better accessibility.
- fix: Update modal padding and event keys to match modern browsers ([#1863](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1863)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [#1359](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1359) This change updates the banner component to use the compound component pattern. For more information, please see the V7 migration guide.
- [#1396](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1396) Change `fixed` prop from component to `position` to set container position (`fixed` position has been set as default).
- [#1329](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1329) Status Indicators currently truncate when they reach their max width of `150px`. After receiving
  requests to increase this, we have upped it by 25% to `200px`.
- [#1409](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1409) Canvas Kit will require teams to be on version ^17.x or at least 16.14 for backwards compatibility and we will remove the jsx pragma and use of css props. This does not mean consumers can’t use the css prop, just that internally we will stop using it. This would require teams to upgrade other parts of their app  including  React, potentially Babel and any other side effects that come with it.
- [#1442](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1442) All findings and changes have been outlines [here](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/1453)
- [#1456](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1456) We are hard deprecating `CookieBanner`, `Header` and `PageHeader`. If you would like to migrate off of these components you can find them under our [Example](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/examples-cookiebanner-react--basic) section in storybook
- [#1460](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1460) Flex, Box and Stack will no longer be imported from `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`. They will now be imported from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/layout`
- [#1477](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1477) -  Combined Icon Buttons with Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary buttons
  - Remove IconButton component
  -  Add a new XS, L sizes
  -  Removed the `toggled` prop when migrating over Icon Buttons
  - Converted `SegmentedControl` into a compound component and it no longer renders `IconButton` as children
  - Changed the values of `IconPosition`: `left` | `right` - > `start` | `end`
  - Refactored `AccentIcon`, `AppletIcon`, `Graphic`, `Icon`, `Svg`, `SystemIcon`, and `SystemIconCircle` to use create component and remove `iconRef` prop and now just pass the ref forward
  - Remove `dataLabel` prop from `PrimaryButton` and `SecondaryButton`
- [#1547](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1547) - Upgrade Typescript to 4.1 and drop support for Typescript <4
  - `Popup.Body` is an overflow container. If your popup buttons are inside the `Popup.Body` element (our examples did this), you will need to move those buttons outside the `Popup.Body` element, otherwise the focus rings may be cut off. See migration guide for more information.
  - Changed the signature of model callbacks and guards. This is handled by our codemod
    - Before:
      - `shouldUpdate({data, state})`
      - `onUpdate({data, prevState})`
    - After:
      - `shouldUpdate(data, state)`
      - `onUpdate(data, prevState)`
- [#1587](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1587) Removed the data wrapper around the `event` in `show` and `hide` events. The arguments are not commonly used, however.
  
  ```tsx
  // v6
  const model = usePopupModel({
    onShow({ data: { event }, prevState }) {
      console.log(event);
    }
  })
  
  // v7
  const model = usePopupModel({
    onShow(event, prevState) {
      console.log(event);
    }
  })
  ```
  
  🤖 The codemod will update all inline guards and callbacks like in this example. If a guard or
  callback was defined outside the model config block, it will not be covered by the codemod.
- [#1585](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1585) This PR contains breaking changes because using new ActionBar requires restructure old version and adding ActionBar.List as sub-component of ActionBar. This changes are covered by codemod but using an overflow behavior requires manual implementation.

  This change updates the CSS selector for the `ChildrenContainer`. We're using [the same selector as what's used in Stack](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/blob/master/modules/labs-react/layout/lib/utils/stack.ts#L10). It is also now SSR-safe by avoiding applying styles to `style` tags. If you were compensating for this bug by adding space for non-button elements in the ActionBar, you'll need to remove that adjustment.

## [v6.3.0](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.3.0) (2022-01-13)

### Hooks

- feat(common): Remove uuid and update unique id generation ([#1408](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1408)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))
  **NOTE for jest snapshots**: This change removes the `uuid` package and instead will generate a one-time client seed and then create auto-incrementing ids. This change will not break UI or automated UI tests. It will break snapshot tests however. Previously, the only way to get stable ids for snapshot tests was to mock the `uuid` module. This was an implementation detail. To make snapshots work again, add the following to your jest setup file:

  ```ts
  import {setUniqueSeed, resetUniqueIdCount} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';

  beforeEach(() => {
    setUniqueSeed('a'); // force set the seed
    resetUniqueIdCount(); // reset the unique id count
  });
  ```

  This will ensure each Jest snapshot has ids that look like `a0` and `a1` and will be the same every time the snapshot is run. Do not use these methods in production though - it may lead to inaccessible applications due to IDREF collisions.

  This commit changes the interaction of contributors to Canvas Kit. All patches will be automatically released. In order to accomplish this, a new pull request link job is run to make sure that all features target a prerelease branch. For example, if you create a new pull request that adds a feature and the current version of Canvas Kit is `v5.2.0`, the target branch should be `prerelease/minor` instead of `master`. Don't worry, the pull request lint job will prevent mistakes. Also the Canvas Kit team can help by changing the base branch of your pull requests.

### Breaking Changes:
- feat(popup-stack): Add adapter API to integrate with other popup systems ([#782](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/782)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)

This is a potentially breaking  change if you use `usePopupStack` and `ReactDOM.createPortal(contents, document.body)`:
We added `createContainer` to `PopupStack`. React no longer controls the element that is given to the the `PopupStack`. The `PopupStack` will now create a containing element that your content should render into. If you recognize this pattern, you'll need to render into `stackRef.current` instead of `document.body`.

Before:
```tsx
const ref = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

usePopupStack(ref)

React.createPortal(contents, document.body)
```

Now
```tsx
const stackRef = usePopupStack()

React.createPortal(contents, stackRef.current)
```
