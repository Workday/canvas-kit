# Canvas Kit 4.0 Migration Guide

Below are the breaking changes made in Canvas Kit v4. Please reach out if you have any questions
about the update.

CSS users rejoice! :tada: No breaking changes in this release. The following changes all relate to
our React infrastructure and components.

## Infrastructure Upgrades

Breaking:

- React & ReactDOM upgraded to 16.12 (https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/533)
  - We are now fully adopting hooks, so <= 16.7 is no longer supported

Non-breaking:

- Typescript upgraded to v3.8 (https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/533)
  - [downlevel-dts](https://github.com/sandersn/downlevel-dts) was used to resolve breaking changes
    in `typescript@3.7`, so older versions of typescript are still supported. However, it is
    recommended to use v3.8.

## Breaking Component Changes

### Button

We've refactored our Button components to simplify logic and add support for theming.

PRs:

- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/471
- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/509
- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/527

#### Changes

- Some of the button variants have been split into different components to prevent invalid API
  combinations. `DeleteButton`, `HighlightButton`, and `OutlineButton` are now separate components
  with their own interface. Here are some of the invalid prop combinations that are no longer
  possible:

  - Delete button with a data label or icon
  - Dropdown button with a data label or icon
  - Highlight button with a data label
  - Highlight button without an icon
  - Dropdown with variants other than primary and secondary
  - Small buttons with an icon or data label
  - Small Highlight button
  - Small Dropdown button
  - etc.

  - **Required changes:**
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.Delete}>` > `<DeleteButton>`
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.Highlight}>` > `<HighlightButton>`
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.OutlineSecondary}>` > `<OutlineButton>`
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.OutlinePrimary}>` >
      `<OutlineButton variant={OutlineButton.Variant.Primary}>`
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.OutlineInverse}>` >
      `<OutlineButton variant={OutlineButton.Variant.Inverse}>`
    - All invalid prop combinations (noted above) will need to be remedied

- The majority of the button variant types have changed. `BaseButtonProps` is no longer available as
  each button variant has their own interface.
- React >= 16.8 required for hooks
- Spacing within buttons has been corrected to match the specs. This may cause horizontal flow
  changes
- `TextButton` now only allows `TextButtonSize.Small` and `TextButtonSize.Medium`. **Required
  changes:**
  - `TextButtonSize.Medium` > `"small"` or `TextButtonSize.Small`
  - `TextButtonSize.Large` > `"medium"` or `TextButtonSize.Medium`
- All caps variants for TextButton have been turned into a prop
  - **Required changes:**
  - `<TextButton variant={TextButton.Variant.AllCaps}>` > `<TextButton allCaps={true}>`
  - `<TextButton variant={TextButton.Variant.InverseAllCaps}>` >
    `<TextButton variant={TextButton.Variant.Inverse} allCaps={true}>`
- All caps large/medium text buttons now correctly use 16px font (up from 14)

#### Quality of Life changes:

With the new components for variants and the simpler types for sizes, the code for complex buttons
is much more concise.

Before:

```tsx
<Button variant={Button.Variant.OutlineSecondary} size={Button.Size.Large}>
  Label
</Button>
```

After:

```tsx
<OutlineButton size="large">Label</OutlineButton>
```

### IconButtonToggleGroup

This component has been renamed to `SegmentedControl` and has been converted into it's own component
(`@workday/canvas-kit-react-segmented-control`). `IconButtonToggleGroup` is no longer exported from
`@workday/canvas-kit-react-button`.

PRs:

- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/505
- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/524

Before:

```tsx
import {IconButtonToggleGroup} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';

<IconButtonToggleGroup>
  <IconButton icon={listViewIcon} title="List View" aria-label="List View" />
  <IconButton icon={worksheetsIcon} title="Worksheets" aria-label="Worksheets" />
</IconButtonToggleGroup>;
```

After:

```tsx
import {SegmentedControl} from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react-segmented-control';

<SegmentedControl>
  <IconButton icon={listViewIcon} title="List View" aria-label="List View" />
  <IconButton icon={worksheetsIcon} title="Worksheets" aria-label="Worksheets" />
</SegmentedControl>;
```

### Modal

Modal now uses React Portals which could cause a visual breaking change related to z-indexing
