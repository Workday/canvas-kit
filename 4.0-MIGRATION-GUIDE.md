# Canvas Kit 4.0 Migration Guide

Below are the breaking changes made in Canvas Kit v4. Please reach out if you have any questions
about the update.

CSS users rejoice! :tada: No breaking changes in this release. The following changes all relate to
our React infrastructure and components.

## Infrastructure Upgrades

Breaking:

- React & ReactDOM upgraded to 16.12 (https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/533)
  - We are now fully adopting hooks, so <= 16.7 is no longer supported

Non-breaking:

- Typescript upgraded to v3.8 (https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/533)
  - [downlevel-dts](https://github.com/sandersn/downlevel-dts) was used to resolve breaking changes
    in `typescript@3.7`, so older versions of typescript are still supported. However, it is
    recommended to use v3.8.

## Breaking Component Changes

### General

- We've moved away from using `SyntheticEvent` typing in favor of using more accurate types
  (https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/499)
- Popper dependency has been upgraded to v2 and now all popups use React Portals (potential z-index
  breaking change)

### Core

We've made minor changes to our hyperlink styles based on feedback from accessibility. As part of
this change, we've also added a new `Hyperlink` component to make applying these styles easier.

### Button

We've refactored our Button components to simplify logic and add support for theming.

PRs:

- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/471
- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/509
- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/527
- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/540
- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/541

#### Changes

- Some of the button variants have been split into different components to prevent invalid API
  combinations. `DeleteButton`, `HighlightButton`, and `OutlineButton` are now separate components
  with their own interface. Here are some of the invalid prop combinations that are no longer
  possible:

  - Delete button with a data label or icon
  - Dropdown button with a data label or icon
  - Highlight button with a data label
  - Highlight button without an icon
  - Dropdown with variants other than primary and secondary
  - Small buttons with an icon or data label
  - Small Highlight button
  - Small Dropdown button
  - etc.

  - **Required changes:**
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.Delete}>` > `<DeleteButton>`
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.Highlight}>` > `<HighlightButton>`
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.OutlineSecondary}>` > `<OutlineButton>`
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.OutlinePrimary}>` >
      `<OutlineButton variant={OutlineButton.Variant.Primary}>`
    - `<Button variant={Button.Variant.OutlineInverse}>` >
      `<OutlineButton variant={OutlineButton.Variant.Inverse}>`
    - All invalid prop combinations (noted above) will need to be remedied

- The majority of the button variant types have changed. `BaseButtonProps` is no longer available as
  each button variant has their own interface.
- React >= 16.8 required for hooks
- Spacing within buttons has been corrected to match the specs. This may cause horizontal flow
  changes
- `TextButton` now only allows `TextButtonSize.Small` and `TextButtonSize.Medium`. **Required
  changes:**
  - `TextButtonSize.Medium` > `"small"` or `TextButtonSize.Small`
  - `TextButtonSize.Large` > `"medium"` or `TextButtonSize.Medium`
- All caps variants for TextButton have been turned into a prop
  - **Required changes:**
  - `<TextButton variant={TextButton.Variant.AllCaps}>` > `<TextButton allCaps={true}>`
  - `<TextButton variant={TextButton.Variant.InverseAllCaps}>` >
    `<TextButton variant={TextButton.Variant.Inverse} allCaps={true}>`
- All caps large/medium text buttons now correctly use 16px font (up from 14)
- Text button has some minor visual changes for various interaction states

#### Quality of Life changes:

With the new components for variants and the simpler types for sizes, the code for complex buttons
is much more concise.

Before:

```tsx
<Button variant={Button.Variant.OutlineSecondary} size={Button.Size.Large}>
  Label
</Button>
```

After:

```tsx
<OutlineButton size="large">Label</OutlineButton>
```

### IconButtonToggleGroup

This component has been renamed to `SegmentedControl` and has been converted into it's own component
(`@workday/canvas-kit-react-segmented-control`). `IconButtonToggleGroup` is no longer exported from
`@workday/canvas-kit-react-button`.

PRs:

- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/505
- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/524

Before:

```tsx
import {IconButtonToggleGroup} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';

<IconButtonToggleGroup>
  <IconButton icon={listViewIcon} title="List View" aria-label="List View" />
  <IconButton icon={worksheetsIcon} title="Worksheets" aria-label="Worksheets" />
</IconButtonToggleGroup>;
```

After:

```tsx
import {SegmentedControl} from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react-segmented-control';

<SegmentedControl>
  <IconButton icon={listViewIcon} title="List View" aria-label="List View" />
  <IconButton icon={worksheetsIcon} title="Worksheets" aria-label="Worksheets" />
</SegmentedControl>;
```

### InputProvider

Our `InputProvider` did not work with React Portals (since the popups get placed outside of the
`InputProvider` container `div`. `InputProvider` provider has been updated to use `document.body`
(configurable with the `containerElement` prop).

PR: https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/546

---

### Modal

Modal now uses React Portals which could cause a visual breaking change related to z-indexing

PRs:

- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/419

---

### Popper

`Popper` was changed to a Functional Component with a forwarded ref. If you passed a `ref` object to
`Popper` before, it will now point to the element rather than the `Popper` instance.

PR: https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/528

---

### Tooltip

Tooltip now uses React Portals and has been completely updated to make attaching tooltips much
easier.

PR:

- https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/528

The original `Tooltip` did little more than add a `role="tooltip"` to a styled component. The
original tooltip is now exported as `TooltipContainer` to make it easier to migrate without
rewriting all tooltips. The new experience is much better and will remove the need for wrapping
components, but if you'd like to keep using the old tooltip as is, your imports will have to be
updated to use the old API: **Before:**

```ts
import {Tooltip} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-tooltip';
```

**After:**

```ts
import {TooltipContainer as Tooltip} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-tooltip';
```

Also with this change, the tooltip no longer gets the role `tooltip` and must be added manually.
