# Canvas Kit React

This project provides a set of React components that can be used to implement user experiences
consistent with [Workday's design principles](https://design.workday.com/).

**:white_check_mark: For a list of available react modules see
[Canvas Kit Component Status](COMPONENT_STATUS.md)**

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the respository and run `yarn`
2.  Run `yarn build`
3.  Run `yarn start` to start [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
4.  Visit [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/)

## Creating a module

1.  Run `yarn create-module`
2.  Enter in a module name, description and author
3.  (optional) Add any required dependencies on other modules
4.  (optional) If you added any extra dependencies, run `yarn`
5.  Start Storybook `yarn start`
6.  Navigate to [http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/) and find your new module's story
7.  Begin editing your new React component in `modules/canvas-kit-react-<NAME>/index.js`!

## Exporting your module

1. If your module's `index.ts` has a default export, make sure it is available as a named export as
   well. This allows for greater flexibility in how developers consume your module.
2. Add `export * from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-<NAME>'` to `modules/canvas-kit-react/index.ts` so
   that consumers of our bundle module (`@workday/canvas-kit-react`) can use your module too.

## Building modules

**`yarn build`**

This will build all modules' CSS and JS.

## Testing modules

**`yarn test`**

This will start the unit tests and run code coverage.

**`yarn updateSnaps`**

If you know you've made a breaking visual change, use this command to update your snapshot tests.
This will add files to your workspace that you'll need to commit.

## Code Style Guide

This project follows UIC's
[WD-components Style Guide](https://ghe.megaleo.com/UIC/wd-components/blob/master/docs/STYLEGUIDE.md).
Rules are enforced using [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and code formatting is
provided through [Prettier](prettier.io).

To lint using TSLint, use `yarn lint`. To format and lint your code (careful - this can rewrite
files), use `yarn format`.

Code formatting will occur automatically before `git commit` for files staged using `git add`.
