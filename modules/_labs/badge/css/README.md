### üìù Notes

#### Accessibility

`aria-live="polite"` informs the screen reader to announce changes when the user is idle. However,
if the count in this badge is static and not live-updated, please remove `aria-live="polite"` to
prevent misinforming screen readers and causing unintentional announcements.

```html
<span class="wdc-badge aria-label="3 direct reports">1</span>
```

#### Formatting

Badges with more than 999 notifications should display '999+'

```html
<span class="wdc-badge aria-live="polite" aria-label="999+ unread notifications">
  999+
</span>
```
