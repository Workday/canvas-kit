## Codemod

Please use our [codemod package](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod)
to automatically update your code to work with most of the breaking changes in v10.

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v10 [path]
```

Alternatively, if you're unable to run the codemod successfully using `npx`, you can install the
codemod package as a dev dependency, run it with `yarn`, and then remove the package after you're
finished.

```sh
> yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-codemod --dev
> yarn canvas-kit-codemod v10 [path]
> yarn remove @workday/canvas-kit-codemod
```

> The codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files. You'll need to manually edit
> other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.). You may need to run your linter after executing
> the codemod, as its resulting formatting (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project
> conventions.

The codemod will handle _most_ but _not all_ of the breaking changes in 10. **Breaking changes
handled by the codemod are marked with ðŸ¤– in the Upgrade Guide.**

**Please verify all changes made by the codemod.** As a safety precaution, we recommend committing
the changes from the codemod as a single isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can
roll back more easily if necessary.

## Removals

Removals are deletions from our codebase and you can no longer consume this component. We've either
promoted or replaced a component or utility.

## useBanner

We have removed the `useBanner` hook, the only function of which was to add `aria-labelledby` and
`aria-describedby` references to the text inside of the Banner. This was not required for
accessibility, and browsers can compute the name of the Banner from the text given inside.

## Deprecations

### Input Icon Container

**PR:** [#2332](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2332)

We've deprecated `InputIconContainer` from [Main](#main) because it doesn't handle bidirectionality
or icons at the start of an input. Please use
[`InputGroup`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/components-inputs-text-input--icons)
instead.

### Space Numbers

**PR:** [#2345](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2345)

We've deprecated `spaceNumbers`. Please use our `rem` based
[`space`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/tokens--space) tokens. In the case where
you need to calculate a value, use
[CSS calc()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) instead.

Example using `space` with calc instead of deprecated `spaceNumbers`.

```tsx
// With deprecated `spaceNumbers`
{
  paddingLeft: spaceNumbers.xl + 2; // 42px
}
```

```tsx
// With `rem` based `space` tokens
{
  padding: `calc(${space.xl} + 2px)`; // 42px
}
```

For more information on how to handle this migration, you can reference our
[discussion](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/2343).

### Table

**PR:** [#2344](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2344)

We've deprecated `Table` and `TableRow` as well as all of their exported members. Please use
[`Table`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/preview-table--basic) in
[Preview](#preview) instead.

### Select Preview

**PR:** [#2309](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2309)

We've deprecated `Select` from [Preview](#preview). Please use
[`Select` in Main](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/components-inputs-select--basic)
instead.

## Token Updates

### Space and Depth

**PR:** [#2229](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2229)

In v10, we have updated our `space` and `depth` token values from `px` to `rem`. This is based on
the default browser font size which is `16px`.

These updates just mean that we have moved the values from `px` to `rem`. The values have been
updated on a 1:1 basis. None of the base value have changed, just the unit.

Below is a table to show what each token value is, what is corresponds too and what the new `rem`
value is in `px`:

| px Value | rem Value | space Token |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0        | 0         | zero        |
| 4px      | 0.25rem   | xxxs        |
| 8px      | 0.5rem    | xxs         |
| 12px     | 0.75rem   | xs          |
| 16px     | 1rem      | s           |
| 24px     | 1.5rem    | m           |
| 32px     | 2rem      | l           |
| 40px     | 2.5rem    | xl          |
| 64px     | 4rem      | xxl         |
| 80px     | 5rem      | xxxl        |

You can convert a `px` value to a `rem` value by dividing your `px` value by `16`(if your default
browser font size hasn't been updated, the value will be `16`).

For example:

| Equation    | rem Value |
| ----------- | --------- |
| `16px/16px` | `1rem`    |
| `32px/16px` | `2rem`    |
| `8px/16px`  | `0.5rem`  |

#### Why Did We Make This Change?

We wanted to move away from absolute units in tokens to relative units for better accessibility and
adaptability to different viewport/screen sizes. If a user changes their default browser font size,
these sizes should change along with it. Since `px` are a fixed unit and do not scale, utilizing
`rem` will allow these tokens to scale with a new default font size.

## Component Updates

### Buttons

We re-factored how we styled Buttons to use our `createStyles` utility function. We don't anticipate
this as a breaking change but, there may be slight changes to visual test.

**PR:** [#2285](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2285)

#### Button Icon Fill

Icons will no longer be "filled" on toggle. This decision was made to not have the exisitng icon
look so different in the toggled state.

#### Button Focus Ring Update

We found that focus ring was not consistent across all Buttons. We have made some changes to create
a consistent focus ring across all Buttons and variants. These will need to be taken note of due to
some small changes visually with Buttons.

- `PrimaryButton`: `inverse` variant now has the same focus ring as default variant and as
  `SecondaryButton`.

Also, `colors` will no longer support the `focusRing` option.

```tsx
import {focusRing} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';

// before
<PrimaryButton
  colors={{
    // other colors
    focus: {
      // other colors
     focusRing: focusRing(/* options */)
    }
  }}
/>

// after
<PrimaryButton
  colors={{
    // other colors
    focus: {
      // other colors
    }
  }}
  css={{
    ':focus-visible': focusRing(/* options */)
  }}
/>;
```

### Popups

All Popup components including `Menu` and `Popup` have increased the top and bottom spacing between
the target and popup to `4px`.

### Select (Main)

**PR:** [#2309](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2309)

We've converted `Select` into a
[compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/) which provides
a flexible API and access to its internals via its subcomponents.

```tsx
// v9
<FormField label="Pizza Size">
  <Select onChange={handleChange} value={value}>
    <SelectOption label="Small" value="small" />
    <SelectOption label="Medium" value="medium" />
    <SelectOption label="Large" value="large" />
  </Select>
</FormField>
```

```tsx
// v10
<Select items={['Small', 'Medium', 'Large']}>
  <FormField label="Pizza Size" inputId="pizza">
    <Select.Input id="pizza" onChange={e => handleChange(e)} id="pizza" />
    <Select.Popper>
      <Select.Card maxHeight="200px">
        <Select.List>
          {item => {
            return <Select.Item>{item}</Select.Item>;
          }}
        </Select.List>
      </Select.Card>
    </Select.Popper>
  </FormField>
</Select>
```

This component also does not have a border around the `Menu` component as the
[Select in Preview](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/preview-select-left-label--default)
has.

## Glossary

### Main

Our Main package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-react` has
undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for use in product.

Breaking changes to code in Main will only occur during major version updates and will always be
communicated in advance and accompanied by migration strategies.

---

### Preview

Our Preview package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at
`@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react` has undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for
use in product, but may not be up to the high code standards upheld in the [Main](#main) package.
Preview is analagous to code in beta.

Breaking changes are unlikely, but possible, and can be deployed to Preview at any time without
triggering a major version update, though such changes will be communicated in advance and
accompanied by migration strategies.

Generally speaking, our goal is to eventually promote code from Preview to [Main](#main).
Occasionally, a component with the same name will exist in both [Main](#main) and Preview (for
example, see Segmented Control in [Preview](/components/buttons/segmented-control/) and
[Main](https://d2krrudi3mmzzw.cloudfront.net/v8/?path=/docs/components-buttons-segmented-control--basic)).
In these cases, Preview serves as a staging ground for an improved version of the component with a
different API. The component in [Main](#main) will eventually be replaced with the one in Preview.

---

### Labs

Our Labs package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`
has **not** undergone a full design and a11y review. Labs serves as an incubator space for new and
experimental code and is analagous to code in alpha.

Breaking changes can be deployed to Labs at any time without triggering a major version update and
may not be subject to the same rigor in communcation and migration strategies reserved for breaking
changes in [Preview](#preview) and [Main](#main).
