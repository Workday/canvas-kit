# Canvas Kit 7.0 Migration Guide

Below are the breaking changes made in Canvas Kit v7. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you have
any questions about the update.

- [Codemod](#codemod)
- [ActionBar Component Updates](#actionbar-component-updates)

## Codemod

Please use our [codemod package](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod)
to automatically update your code to work with a majority of the breaking changes in the migration
from Canvas Kit v6 to v7:

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v7 [path]
```

> Note: This codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` extensions. You may need to make
> some manual changes in other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.).

> Note: You may need to run your linter after executing the codemod, as it's resulting formatting
> (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project's styling.

**Breaking changes accounted for by this codemod will be marked with a ðŸ¤–.**

**Please verify all changes made by the codemod. As a safety precaution, we recommend committing the
changes from the codemod as a single isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can
rollback more easily if necessary.**

[Let us know](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you
encounter any issues or use cases that we've missed. The `@workday/canvas-kit-codemod` package will
help us maintain additional codemod transforms to make future migrations easier.

## ActionBar Component Updates

We've refactored our ActionBar components to simplify logic.

PR: https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1396

**Changes:**

- Component has been converted to compound component.
- `fixed` prop has been removed from component.
- Now ActionBar uses `position` prop to set container position instead `fixed` prop.
- Fixed position has been set as default if there is not passed `position` prop.
