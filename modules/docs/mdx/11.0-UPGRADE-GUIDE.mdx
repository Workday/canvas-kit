## Codemod

We've provided a [codemod](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod) to
automatically update your code to work with most of the breaking changes in v11. **Breaking changes
handled by the codemod are marked with ðŸ¤– in the Upgrade Guide.**

A codemod is a script that makes programmatic transformations on your codebase by traversing the
[AST](https://www.codeshiftcommunity.com/docs/understanding-asts), identifying patterns, and making
prescribed changes. This greatly decreases opportunities for error and reduces the number of manual
updates, which allows you to focus on changes that need your attention. **We highly recommend you
use the codemod for these reasons.**

If you're new to running codemods or if it's been a minute since you've used one, there are a few
things you'll want to keep in mind.

- Our codemods are meant to be run sequentially. For example, if you're using v7 of Canvas Kit,
  you'll need to run the v8 and v9 codemod before you run v11.
- The codemod will update your code to be compatible with the specified version, but it will **not**
  remove outdated dependencies or upgrade dependencies to the latest version. You'll need to upgrade
  dependencies on your own.
  - We recommend upgrading dependencies before running the codemod.
  - Always review your `package.json` files to make sure your dependency versions look correct.
- The codemod will not handle every breaking change in v11. You will likely need to make some manual
  changes to be compatible. Use our Upgrade Guide as a checklist.
- Codemods are not bulletproof.
  - Conduct a thorough PR and QA review of all changes to ensure no regressions were introduced.
  - As a safety precaution, we recommend committing the changes from the codemod as a single
    isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can roll back more easily if necessary.

We're here to help! Automatic changes to your codebase can feel scary. You can always reach out to
our team. We'd be very happy to walk you through the process to set you up for success.

### Instructions

The easiest way to run our codemod is to use `npx`.

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v11 [path]
```

Be sure to provide specific directories that need to be updated via the `[path]` argument. This
decreases the amount of AST the codemod needs to traverse and reduces the chances of the script
having an error. For example, if your source code lives in `src/`, use `src/` as your `[path]`. Or,
if you have a monorepo with three packages using Canvas Kit, provide those specific packages as your
`[path]`.

Alternatively, if you're unable to run the codemod successfully using `npx`, you can install the
codemod package as a dev dependency, run it with `yarn`, and then remove the package after you're
finished.

```sh
> yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-codemod --dev
> yarn canvas-kit-codemod v11 [path]
> yarn remove @workday/canvas-kit-codemod
```

> The codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files. You'll need to manually edit
> other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.). You may need to run your linter after executing
> the codemod, as its resulting formatting (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project
> conventions.

## Component Promotions

### Table

**PR:** [#2600](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2600)

We've promoted the `Table` compound component in [Preview](#preview) to [Main](#main). This replaces
the existing `Table` component with a compound component and will consist of a new compound
component API.

> `rowState` prop is no longer a part of the `Table` component.

In v10, the `Table` component in [Main](#main) only exposed a `Table` and `TableRow` component to
build tables.

In v11, `Table` now exposes every subcomponent of a semantic HTML
[Table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table). While more verbose, it
provides more flexibility for customization.

See below for examples of the differences between the v10 `Table` and the v11 `Table` compound
component.

v10:

```tsx
<Table>
  <thead>
    <TableRow header={true}>
      <th>Header Text</th>
    </TableRow>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <TableRow>
      <td>Cell Text</td>
    </TableRow>
  </tbody>
</Table>
```

v11:

```tsx
<Table>
  <Table.Head>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Header>Header Text</Table.Header>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Head>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>Cell Text</Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>
```

Please refer to the
[Table examples](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/components-containers-table--basic)
for how to implement new tables.

> **NOTE:** If you were using the [Preview](#preview) `Table` compound component, then you will need
> to update your import from `"@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react/table"` to
> `"@workday/canvas-kit-react/table"`.

## Deprecations

We add the [@deprecated](https://jsdoc.app/tags-deprecated.html) JSDoc tag to code we plan to remove
in a future major release. This signals consumers to migrate to a more stable alternative before the
deprecated code is removed.

### Form Field Main

**PR:** [#2472](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2472)

We've deprecated `FormField` from [Main](#main) in favor of our compound component `FormField` in
[Preview](#preview). Please use
[`FormField`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=//docs/preview-inputs-form-field--basic)
instead.

---

### Label Text

**PR:** [#2455](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2455)

We've deprecated `LabelText` from [Main](#main) in favor of our compound component `FormField.Label`
in [Preview](#preview). Please use
[`FormField.Label`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=//docs/preview-inputs-form-field--basic)
instead.

If you still want to use a `label` element outside of the context of a form, you can use `Text`
instead.

---

### Text Area Preview

**PR:** [#2472](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2472)

We've deprecated `TextArea` from [Preview](#preview) in favor of our compound component `FormField`
in [Preview](#preview). Please use
[`FormField`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=//docs/preview-inputs-form-field--basic)
instead.

---

### Text Input Preview

**PR:** [#2472](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2472)

We've deprecated `TextInput` from [Preview](#preview) in favor of our compound component `FormField`
in [Preview](#preview). Please use
[`FormField`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=//docs/preview-inputs-form-field--basic)
instead.

---

## Component Style Updates

These changes are to address discrepancies that were found between Canvas Kit Design Specs and
Canvas Kit.

We've made some small styling updates to: `Table`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `SecondaryButton`,
`TertiaryButton`, `DeleteButton`, `TextInput` and `TextArea`.

**PR:** [#2485](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2485)

### Component Token Updates

The following components have been updated to use our [new system tokens](insert link).

- Text

## Component Updates

### Card

**PR:** [#2471](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2471)

`Card` and its subcomponents have been refactored to use our new
[styling utilities](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api)
and [tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs). `Card`
no longer extends the `Box` component, however, it still supports Emotion `styled` and style props.

### Checkbox

**PR:** [#2542](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2542)

`Checkbox` now uses
[Canvas Tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs) and
our
[new styling utilities](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api).
The component now supports the `cs` prop, but otherwise the API has not changed. It should behave
identically as it did in previous versions.

### Combobox

**PR:** [#2570](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2570)

`Combobox` has been refactored to use our
[new styling utilities](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api)
and [tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs). The
component now supports the `cs` prop, but otherwise the API has not changed.

### Count Badge

**PR:** [#2442](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2442)

`CountBadge` now uses `createComponent`,
[Canvas Tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs), and
our new
[styling utilities](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api).
The component API has not been changed, and it should behave identically as it did in previous
versions.

### Form Field (Preview)

**PR:** [#2472](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2472)

`FormField` in [Preview](#preview) is a compound component and we intend to promote it in a future
version to replace the `FormField` in [Main](#main). Because of this, we've refactored how errors
are applied to `FormField` in [Preview](#preview) in order to match the API from the `FormField` in
[Main](#main).

- `hasError` prop on the `FormField` has been renamed to `error`.
- `error` accepts `"error" | "alert" | ""` instead of a boolean value.
- `orientation` prop defaults to `vertical` and is no longer required.
- `FormField.Input` can be used by any `input`.
- `FormField` does **not** support the `useFieldSet` prop that the `FormField` in [Main](#main)
  does. In order to achieve the same behavior, set the `as` prop on the `FormField` element to
  `fieldset` and the `as` prop of `FormField.Label` to `legend`.

```tsx
// v10 FormField in Preview
import {FormField} from '@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react/form-field';
import {TextInput} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/text-input';

//...

<FormField orientation="vertical" hasError={true}>
  <FormField.Label>Password</FormField.Label>
  <FormField.Input as={TextInput} type="password" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
  <FormField.Hint>Must Contain a number and a capital letter</FormField.Hint>
</FormField>;

// v11
import {FormField} from '@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react/form-field';
import {TextInput} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/text-input';

//...

<FormField error="error">
  <FormField.Label>Password</FormField.Label>
  <FormField.Container>
    <FormField.Input as={TextInput} type="password" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
    <FormField.Hint>Must Contain a number and a capital letter</FormField.Hint>
  </FormField.Container>
</FormField>;
```

ðŸ¤– The codemod will handle the change of `hasError` to `error` for you automatically.

### Icons

All icons components including `Svg`, `SystemIcon`, `SystemIconCircle`, `AccentIcon`, `AppletIcon`
and `Graphic` now use our new
[Canvas Tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs) and
[new styling utilities](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api).

- Components now support the `cs` prop. -`styles` prop has been removed.

**Note: Passing a token name to a style prop will be not supported in a future major version.**

```tsx
// This will no longer be supported in a future major version
<SystemIcon color="blueberry400" .../>

// Use new tokens instead.
<SystemIcon color={base.blueberry400} .../>
```

ðŸ¤– The codemod will handle the change of `styles` to `cs` for you automatically.

#### AccentIcon

- `AccentIconStyles` prop has been deprecated and will be merged with `AccentIconProps` in a future
  version.
- `accentIconStyles` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version as a part of
  implementation of stencils and new tokens. Consider to use `accentIconStencil` to get styles or
  class name.
- `AccentIcon` supports `size` and `color` css variables, along with `size` and `color` props. Both
  ways are supported:

```tsx
// set size or color by props
<AccentIcon color={base.blueberry100} size={24} />;

// set size or color by css vars
import {accentIconStencil} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/icon';

const MyComponent = StyledRadioButton('div')({
  [accentIconStencil.vars.color]: base.berrySmoothie100,
  [accentIconStencil.vars.size]: '2rem',
});

<MyComponent>
  <AccentIcon icon={myIcon} />
</MyComponent>;
```

#### AppletIcon

- `AppletIconStyles` prop has been deprecated and will be merged with `AppletIconProps` in a future
  version.
- `appletIconStyles` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version as a part of
  implementation of stencils and new tokens. Consider using `appletIconStencil` to get styles or
  class name.
- `AppletIcon` supports `size`, `color200`, `color300`, `color400` and `color500` css variables,
  along with `size` and `color` props. Both ways are supported:

```tsx
// set size or color by props
<AppletIcon color="blueberry" size={240} />;

// set size or color by css vars
import {appletIconStencil} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/icon';

const MyComponent = StyledRadioButton('div')({
  [appletIconStencil.vars.size]: '2rem',
  [appletIconStencil.vars.color200]: base.berrySmoothie200,
  [appletIconStencil.vars.color300]: base.berrySmoothie300,
  [appletIconStencil.vars.color400]: base.berrySmoothie400,
  [appletIconStencil.vars.color500]: base.berrySmoothie500,
});

<MyComponent>
  <AppletIcon icon={myIcon} />
</MyComponent>;
```

#### Graphic

- `GraphicStyles` prop has been deprecated and will be merged with `GraphicProps` in a future
  version.
- `graphicStyles` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version as a part of
  implementation of stencils and new tokens. Consider to use `graphicStencil` to get styles or class
  name.
- `width` and `height` props has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Consider
  using `cs` props instead to set svg sizes.

```tsx
// before
<Graphic icon={myGraphic} width={160} />

// after
<Graphic icon={myGraphic} cs={{"& svg": {width: '10rem'}}} />
```

#### Icon

This change only impacts internal Canvas Kit code. `Icon` component has been removed and no longer
used in icons. It was replaced by `Svg` and icon stencils extend `svgStencil`.

#### SystemIcon

- `SystemIconStyles` prop has been deprecated and will be merged with `SystemIconProps` in a future
  version.

  overriding styles:

```tsx
'&:hover': {
  [systemIconStencil.vars.accent]: desiredAccentHoverColor
}
```

- `backgroundHover` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use the following
  when overriding styles:

```tsx
'&:hover': {
  [systemIconStencil.vars.background]: desiredBackgroundHoverColor
}
```

- `fillHover` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use the following when
  overriding styles:

```tsx
'&:hover': {
  [systemIconStencil.vars.fill]: desiredFillHoverColor
}
```

- `fill` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use `color` and specify
  `accent` color if you want `accent` to be different from `color`.

```tsx
'&:hover': {
  [systemIconStencil.vars.fill]: desiredFillHoverColor
}
```

- `systemIconStyles` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version as a part of
  implementation of stencils and new tokens. Consider to use `systemIconStencil` to get styles or
  class name.

- `SystemIcon` supports `size`, `color`, `accentColor` and `background` css variables, along with
  props. Both ways are supported:

```tsx
// set size or color by props
<SystemIcon color={base.blueberry100} size={24} />;

// set size or color by css vars
import {systemIconStencil} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/icon';

const MyComponent = StyledRadioButton('div')({
  [accentIconStencil.vars.size]: '2rem',
  [systemIconStencil.vars.color]: base.berrySmoothie400,
  [systemIconStencil.vars.background]: base.frenchVanilla100,
  // on hover:
  '&:hover': {
    [systemIconStencil.vars.color]: base.berrySmoothie500,
    [systemIconStencil.vars.background]: 'transparent',
  },
});

<MyComponent>
  <SystemIcon icon={myIcon} />
</MyComponent>;
```

### Radio (Preview)

**PR:** [#2546](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2546)

`Radio` and `RadioGroup` now use
[Canvas Tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs) and
our
[new styling utilities](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api).
The component now supports the `cs` prop, but otherwise the API has not changed. It should behave
identically as it did in previous versions.

### Select

**PR:** [#2570](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2570)

`Select` has been refactored to use our
[new styling utilities](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api)
and [tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs). The
component now supports the `cs` prop, but otherwise the API has not changed. It should behave

### Switch

**PR:** [#2583](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2583)

### Text

**PR:** [#2455](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2455)

`Text` has been refactored to use our

and [tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs). It no
longer extends the `Box` component, however, it still supports Emotion `styled` and style props.
Type level components: `Title`, `Heading`, `BodyText` and `Subtext`, have not been changed since
they extend the `Text` component. These changes do not affect the components API.

### StatusIndicator (Preview)

**PR:** [#2620] https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2620

`StatusIndicator` now uses

## Style Utility Updates

### `createStencil`

Stencils were updated to automatically add `box-sizing: border-box` to all stencils. If your stencil
did not add this style already, it may change the way `width` works for the component. Our intent is
to make all elements use border box layouts to make width calculations more predictable. This change
may change the way your component works if you use the `width` style property.

## Glossary

### Main

Our Main package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-react` has
undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for use in product.

Breaking changes to code in Main will only occur during major version updates and will always be
communicated in advance and accompanied by migration strategies.

---

### Preview

Our Preview package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at
`@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react` has undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for
use in product, but may not be up to the high code standards upheld in the [Main](#main) package.
Preview is analagous to code in beta.

Breaking changes are unlikely, but possible, and can be deployed to Preview at any time without
triggering a major version update, though such changes will be communicated in advance and
accompanied by migration strategies.

Generally speaking, our goal is to eventually promote code from Preview to [Main](#main).
Occasionally, a component with the same name will exist in both [Main](#main) and Preview (for
example, see Segmented Control in [Preview](/components/buttons/segmented-control/) and
[Main](https://d2krrudi3mmzzw.cloudfront.net/v8/?path=/docs/components-buttons-segmented-control--basic)).
In these cases, Preview serves as a staging ground for an improved version of the component with a
different API. The component in [Main](#main) will eventually be replaced with the one in Preview.

---

### Labs

Our Labs package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`
has **not** undergone a full design and a11y review. Labs serves as an incubator space for new and
experimental code and is analagous to code in alpha.

Breaking changes can be deployed to Labs at any time without triggering a major version update and
may not be subject to the same rigor in communcation and migration strategies reserved for breaking
changes in [Preview](#preview) and [Main](#main).
