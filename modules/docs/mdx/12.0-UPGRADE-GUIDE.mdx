# Canvas Kit 12.0 Upgrade Guide

This guide contains an overview of the changes in Canvas Kit v12. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you have
any questions.

## Why You Should Upgrade

Canvas Kit v12 is transitioning into a
[new way of styling](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/2265). Theming and building
an in sync Canvas Kit CSS has been at the top of our minds. We've started using our new
[Canvas Tokens Web](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs)
package to take advantage of
[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) and
provide semantic tokens that can translate to theming components.

A note to the reader:

- While we still support our old tokens from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens` in v12, you must
  install our new tokens from `@workday/canvas-tokens-web`. You can find more info in our
  [docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs).
- In this release, we've introduced a
  [new styling API](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-stencil).
  This shouldn't effect the way you currently style your components. Because we're moving away from
  Emotion, support for style props will eventually be removed, however, this API provide backwards
  compatability. If you want to slowly move off of Emotion as well, you can start styling components
  via the `cs` prop or our new styling utilities.

## Canvas Tokens

In v12, all the components listed in this guide have started using our new
[Canvas Tokens Web](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs).
In v10, we provided token fallbacks so that a component would not be missing a token/value if the tokens were not defined. In v12 you must add `@workday/canvas-tokens-web` to ensure our
components are properly styled and the variables are defined. For more information on installing and
using, please reference our tokens
[docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs).

## Codemod

We've provided a [codemod](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod) to
automatically update your code to work with most of the breaking changes in v12. **Breaking changes
handled by the codemod are marked with ðŸ¤– in the Upgrade Guide.**

A codemod is a script that makes programmatic transformations on your codebase by traversing the
[AST](https://www.codeshiftcommunity.com/docs/understanding-asts), identifying patterns, and making
prescribed changes. This greatly decreases opportunities for error and reduces the number of manual
updates, which allows you to focus on changes that need your attention. **We highly recommend you
use the codemod for these reasons.**

If you're new to running codemods or if it's been a minute since you've used one, there are a few
things you'll want to keep in mind.

- Our codemods are meant to be run sequentially. For example, if you're using v10 of Canvas Kit,
  you'll need to run the v11 codemod before you run v12.
- The codemod will update your code to be compatible with the specified version, but it will **not**
  remove outdated dependencies or upgrade dependencies to the latest version. You'll need to upgrade
  dependencies on your own.
  - We recommend upgrading dependencies before running the codemod.
  - Always review your `package.json` files to make sure your dependency versions look correct.
- The codemod will not handle every breaking change in v12. You will likely need to make some manual
  changes to be compatible. Use our Upgrade Guide as a checklist.
- Codemods are not bulletproof.
  - Conduct a thorough PR and QA review of all changes to ensure no regressions were introduced.
  - As a safety precaution, we recommend committing the changes from the codemod as a single
    isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can roll back more easily if necessary.

We're here to help! Automatic changes to your codebase can feel scary. You can always reach out to
our team. We'd be very happy to walk you through the process to set you up for success.

### Instructions

The easiest way to run our codemod is to use `npx` in your terminal.

```sh
npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v12 [path]
```

Be sure to provide specific directories that need to be updated via the `[path]` argument. This
decreases the amount of AST the codemod needs to traverse and reduces the chances of the script
having an error. For example, if your source code lives in `src/`, use `src/` as your `[path]`. Or,
if you have a monorepo with three packages using Canvas Kit, provide those specific packages as your
`[path]`.

Alternatively, if you're unable to run the codemod successfully using `npx`, you can install the
codemod package as a dev dependency, run it with `yarn`, and then remove the package after you're
finished.

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-codemod --dev
yarn canvas-kit-codemod v12 [path]
yarn remove @workday/canvas-kit-codemod
```

> **Note**: The codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files. You'll need to
> manually edit other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.). You may need to run your linter
> after executing the codemod, as its resulting formatting (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match
> your project conventions.

## Deprecations

We add the [@deprecated](https://jsdoc.app/tags-deprecated.html) JSDoc tag to code we plan to remove
in a future major release. This signals consumers to migrate to a more stable alternative before the
deprecated code is removed.

## Removals
Removals are deletions from our codebase and you can no longer consume this component. We've either promoted or replaced a component or utility.

### Select (Preview)

**PR:** [#2796](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2796)

We've removed the `Select` component that was in Preview. Please use the compound [`Select` component from Main](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-inputs-select--basic).

## Component Updates

### Styling API and CSS Tokens

**PRs:** [#2795](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2795)

Several components have been refactored to use our new
[Canvas Tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs) and
[styling API](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api).
The React interface **has not changed**, but CSS variables are now used for dynamic properties.

The following components are affected:

- `Popup, Dialog and Modal`
- `Toast`

> **Note:** These components also support our new `cs` prop for styling. Learn more about styling
> with `cs` in our
> [documentation](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--cs-prop).

### Popup, Dialog and Modal

**PR:** [#2795](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2795)

### Toast

**PR:** [#2795](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2795)

## Style Utility Updates

## Troubleshooting

### My Styles Seem Broken?

Our components are reliant on our new Canvas Tokens Web package. Be sure you install
`@workday/canvas-tokens-web`. For more information, reference our
[Getting Started docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs)
for this package.

### Did You Upgrade All Canvas Kit Related Packages?

In order for all the packages to work in harmony, you must upgrade all Canvas Kit packages to the
same version that you're using, including:

- `@workday/canvas-kit-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-styling`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-react-fonts`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-docs`

## Glossary

### Main

Our Main package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-react` has
undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for use in product.

Breaking changes to code in Main will only occur during major version updates and will always be
communicated in advance and accompanied by migration strategies.

---

### Preview

Our Preview package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at
`@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react` has undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for
use in product, but may not be up to the high code standards upheld in the [Main](#main) package.
Preview is analagous to code in beta.

Breaking changes are unlikely, but possible, and can be deployed to Preview at any time without
triggering a major version update, though such changes will be communicated in advance and
accompanied by migration strategies.

Generally speaking, our goal is to eventually promote code from Preview to [Main](#main).
Occasionally, a component with the same name will exist in both [Main](#main) and Preview (for
example, see Segmented Control in [Preview](/components/buttons/segmented-control/) and
[Main](https://d2krrudi3mmzzw.cloudfront.net/v8/?path=/docs/components-buttons-segmented-control--basic)).
In these cases, Preview serves as a staging ground for an improved version of the component with a
different API. The component in [Main](#main) will eventually be replaced with the one in Preview.

---

### Labs

Our Labs package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`
has **not** undergone a full design and a11y review. Labs serves as an incubator space for new and
experimental code and is analagous to code in alpha.

Breaking changes can be deployed to Labs at any time without triggering a major version update and
may not be subject to the same rigor in communcation and migration strategies reserved for breaking
changes in [Preview](#preview) and [Main](#main). import { opacity } from
"@workday/canvas-tokens-web/dist/es6/system"
