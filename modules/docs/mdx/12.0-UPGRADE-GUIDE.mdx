## Why You Should Upgrade

## Table of contents

- [Removals](#removals)
  - [Select (Preview)](#select-preview)

## Removals
Removals are deletions from our codebase and you can no longer consume this component. We've either promoted or replaced a component or utility.

### Select (Preview)

**PR:** [#2796](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2796)

We've removed the `Select` component that was in Preview. Please use the compound [`Select` component from Main](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-inputs-select--basic).
