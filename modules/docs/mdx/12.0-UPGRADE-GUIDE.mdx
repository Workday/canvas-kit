# Canvas Kit 12.0 Upgrade Guide

This guide contains an overview of the changes in Canvas Kit v12. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you have
any questions.

## Why You Should Upgrade

Canvas Kit v12 is transitioning into a
[new way of styling](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/2265). Theming and building
an in sync Canvas Kit CSS has been at the top of our minds. We've started using our new
[Canvas Tokens Web](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs)
package to take advantage of
[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) and
provide semantic tokens that can translate to theming components.

A note to the reader:

- While we still support our old tokens from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens` in v12, you must
  install our new tokens from `@workday/canvas-tokens-web`. You can find more info in our
  [docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs).
- In this release, we've introduced a
  [new styling API](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-stencil).
  This shouldn't effect the way you currently style your components. Because we're moving away from
  Emotion, support for style props will eventually be removed, however, this API provide backwards
  compatability. If you want to slowly move off of Emotion as well, you can start styling components
  via the `cs` prop or our new styling utilities.

## Canvas Tokens

In v12, all the components listed in this guide have started using our new
[Canvas Tokens Web](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs).

In v12 you must add `@workday/canvas-tokens-web` to ensure our components are properly styled and the
variables are defined. For more information on installing and using, please reference our tokens
[docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs).

## Deprecations

We add the [@deprecated](https://jsdoc.app/tags-deprecated.html) JSDoc tag to code we plan to remove
in a future major release. This signals consumers to migrate to a more stable alternative before the
deprecated code is removed.

## Removals
Removals are deletions from our codebase and you can no longer consume this component. We've either promoted or replaced a component or utility.

### Select (Preview)

**PR:** [#2796](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2796)

We've removed the `Select` component that was in Preview. Please use the compound [Select component from Main](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-inputs-select--basic).

### InputIconContainer

**PR:** [#2838](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2838)

We've removed `InputIconContainer` from Main. Please consider using [InputGroup](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-inputs-text-input--icons) instead.

## Component Updates

### Styling API and CSS Tokens

Several components have been refactored to use our new
[Canvas Tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs) and
[styling API](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api).
The React interface **has not changed**, but CSS variables are now used for dynamic properties.

The following components are affected:

- `Popup`
- `Dialog`
- `Modal`
- `Toast`

> **Note:** These components also support our new `cs` prop for styling. Learn more about styling
> with `cs` in our
> [documentation](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--cs-prop).

### Popup, Dialog and Modal

**PR:** [#2795](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2795)

### Toast

**PR:** [#2795](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2795)

## Style Utility Updates

## Troubleshooting

### My Styles Seem Broken?

Our components are reliant on our new Canvas Tokens Web package. Be sure you install
`@workday/canvas-tokens-web`. For more information, reference our
[Getting Started docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs)
for this package.

### Did You Upgrade All Canvas Kit Related Packages?

In order for all the packages to work in harmony, you must upgrade all Canvas Kit packages to the
same version that you're using, including:

- `@workday/canvas-kit-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-styling`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-react-fonts`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-docs`

## Glossary

### Main

Our Main package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-react` has
undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for use in product.

Breaking changes to code in Main will only occur during major version updates and will always be
communicated in advance and accompanied by migration strategies.

---

### Preview

Our Preview package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at
`@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react` has undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for
use in product, but may not be up to the high code standards upheld in the [Main](#main) package.
Preview is analagous to code in beta.

Breaking changes are unlikely, but possible, and can be deployed to Preview at any time without
triggering a major version update, though such changes will be communicated in advance and
accompanied by migration strategies.

Generally speaking, our goal is to eventually promote code from Preview to [Main](#main).
Occasionally, a component with the same name will exist in both [Main](#main) and Preview (for
example, see Segmented Control in [Preview](/components/buttons/segmented-control/) and
[Main](https://d2krrudi3mmzzw.cloudfront.net/v8/?path=/docs/components-buttons-segmented-control--basic)).
In these cases, Preview serves as a staging ground for an improved version of the component with a
different API. The component in [Main](#main) will eventually be replaced with the one in Preview.

---

### Labs

Our Labs package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`
has **not** undergone a full design and a11y review. Labs serves as an incubator space for new and
experimental code and is analagous to code in alpha.

Breaking changes can be deployed to Labs at any time without triggering a major version update and
may not be subject to the same rigor in communcation and migration strategies reserved for breaking
changes in [Preview](#preview) and [Main](#main). import { opacity } from
"@workday/canvas-tokens-web/dist/es6/system"
