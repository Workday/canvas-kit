This project provides a set of components for the Workday Canvas Design System that can be used to
implement user experiences consistent with
[Workday's design principles](https://design.workday.com/).

## Installation
To get started using Canvas kit React first add or install the module to your existing React project

<InstallBlock command='yarn add' packageName='@workday/canvas-kit-react' />

or

<InstallBlock command='npm install' packageName='@workday/canvas-kit-react' />

After installing Canvas Kit, you need to set up the CanvasProvider at the root of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx`,` index.tsx` or `App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.
This ensures from styling, theming, and focus on our components.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
// 1. import `CanvasProvider` component
import { CanvasProvider } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap CanvasProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <CanvasProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </CanvasProvider>
  )
}
```
