### Main

Our Main package of Canvas Kit components and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-react` has undergone
a full design and a11y review and is approved for use in product.

Breaking changes to code in Main will only occur during major version updates and will always be
communicated in advance and accompanied by migration strategies.

### Preview

Our Preview package of Canvas Kit components and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react`
has undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for use in product, but may not be up to
the high code standards upheld in the [Main](#main) package. Preview is analagous to code in beta.

Breaking changes are unlikely, but possible, and can be deployed to Preview at any time without
triggering a major version update, though such changes will be communicated in advance and
accompanied by migration strategies.

Generally speaking, our goal is to eventually promote code from Preview to [Main](#main).
Occasionally, a component with the same name will exist in both [Main](#main) and Preview (for
example, see Segmented Control in [Preview](/components/buttons/segmented-control/) and
[Main](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit//?path=/docs/components-buttons-segmented-control--docs)).
In these cases, Preview serves as a staging ground for an improved version of the component with a
different API. The component in [Main](#main) will eventually be replaced with the one in Preview.

### Labs

Our Labs package of Canvas Kit components and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react` has
**not** undergone a full design and a11y review. Labs serves as an incubator space for new and
experimental code and is analagous to code in alpha.

Breaking changes can be deployed to Labs at any time without triggering a major version update and
may not be subject to the same rigor in communcation and migration strategies reserved for breaking
changes in [Preview](#preview) and [Main](#main).
`import { opacity } from "@workday/canvas-tokens-web/dist/es6/system"`
