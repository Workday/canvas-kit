## Side Panel As Navigation

This example demonstrates SidePanel as a navigation system that can be reduced into a "compact view"
to save horizontal space on screen. It combines semantic HTML nested list markup with Canvas Kit's
`<Expandable>` component to create an accordion. When in compact view, the Canvas Kit `<Menu>`
component is used to create the fly-out menus. Both of these components are implemented according to
the [W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) to provide a
wide range of support for accessibility.

- The `<SidePanel>` uses the `as` prop to render with a semantic HTML `<nav>` element
- The SidePanel's heading element with the `labelProps` must remain in the DOM even while the
  component is in compact view, else the `aria-labelledby` reference for the toggle button will
  become invalid. The `hidden` attribute is conditionally set on the heading based on the `expanded`
  state of the SidePanel provided by the `useSidePanel` hook.
- The semantic HTML nested list markup helps support non-visual screen reader users understand the
  nested hierarchy of the elements inside the expandable containers
- In the compact view, the `<Tooltip>` component is used to provide an accessible name to the icon
  button menu targets
