### Canvas Provider

If you use Emotion for styling your components, the `<CanvasProvider>` ensures your styles will merge as expected. Note:
Custom use of `<CacheProvider>` provided by Emotion is not supported. `@workday/canvas-kit-styling`
owns the creating of the cache reference. This ensures both static styling and Emotionâ€™s dynamic
styling solutions work together. In most cases you'll want to wrap your application at the root
level in `<CanvasProvider>`.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  CanvasProvider,
} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';
// Ensure CSS variables are defined. You Can also do this at the root index.css
import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/base/_variables.css';
import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/brand/_variables.css';
import '@workday/canvas-tokens-web/css/system/_variables.css';

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <CanvasProvider>
        <main>
          <p>Get Started With Canvas Kit</p>
        </main>
    </CanvasProvider>
  );
};
```
