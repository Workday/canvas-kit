## Codemod

Please use our [codemod package](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod)
to automatically update your code to work with most of the breaking changes in v9.

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v9 [path]
```

Alternatively, if you're unable to run the codemod successfully using `npx`, you can install the
codemod package as a dev dependency, run it with `yarn`, and then remove the package after you're
finished.

```sh
> yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-codemod --dev
> yarn canvas-kit-codemod v9 [path]
> yarn remove @workday/canvas-kit-codemod
```

> The codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files. You'll need to manually edit
> other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.). You may need to run your linter after executing
> the codemod, as its resulting formatting (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project
> conventions.

The codemod will handle _most_ but _not all_ of the breaking changes in v9. **Breaking changes
handled by the codemod are marked with 🤖 in the Upgrade Guide.**

**Please verify all changes made by the codemod.** As a safety precaution, we recommend committing
the changes from the codemod as a single isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can
roll back more easily if necessary.

## Component Deprecations

### Deprecation Types

#### Soft Deprecation

A soft-deprecated component is still available with its full functionality, but it will have been
renamed with a prefix to indicate its soft-deprecated status. It will also include a console warning
announcing its deprecation. This warning will only be triggered on the component's initial render.

Soft-deprecated types and utilities will also have been renamed but generally will not trigger a
console warning.

#### Hard Deprecation

A hard-deprecated component or package is no longer available. You will need to follow the method
prescribed in our Upgrade Guide to update your application. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) to our team
directly if you need additional help.

### Drawer

<!---
TODO: Please review this section with documenting SidePanel deprication
-->

We've [hard-deprecated](#hard-deprecation) `Drawer` and this component has been fully removed from
Canvas Kit. Consider using the
[Side Panel](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/preview-side-panel--basic). Be Aware
that `SidePanel` from the Main package is planned to be replaced by the one from Preview. We suggest
you use the Preview version of `SidePanel` until the one in Main is replaced with it.

---

### Layout and Column

`Layout` and `Column` components have bee fully removed from Canvas Kit due to
[hard-deprecated](#hard-deprecation) and are no longer available for use. Consider using the
[Grid](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/components-containers-grid--basic). The
Grid component offers several benefits over the deprecated components and provides a more robust and
flexible layout solution.

Please refer to
[the Examples section](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/examples-layouts--custom-column-positioning)
for ideas on how to replace the deprecated Layout component with the Grid component. This will
provide you with a deeper understanding of how to set custom column width or positioning using the
Grid component.

## Component Updates

### Buttons

We've changed the default `type` attribute of all our `buttons` to be `type="button"` instead of the
default `type="submit"`. This is a breaking change if you expected a button to submit by default.

We found an issue where the default action for `form` controls like `input` and `textarea` is to
click the first `submit` `button` which in some cases is not a `submit` button.

An example of this causing issues was our `Modal.CloseIcon` and `Modal.CloseButton`. When the
`Modal` is wrapped in a `form` element, the close icon would submit the `form`.

This change affects all of our `buttons` including:
`PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton, TertiaryButton, ToolbarButton`.

If you still wish for a specific `button` within a `form` to submit, just add the attribute
`type="submit"`.
