## Codemod

Please use our [codemod package](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod)
to automatically update your code to work with most of the breaking changes in v9.

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v9 [path]
```

Alternatively, if you're unable to run the codemod successfully using `npx`, you can install the
codemod package as a dev dependency, run it with `yarn`, and then remove the package after you're
finished.

```sh
> yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-codemod --dev
> yarn canvas-kit-codemod v9 [path]
> yarn remove @workday/canvas-kit-codemod
```

> The codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files. You'll need to manually edit
> other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.). You may need to run your linter after executing
> the codemod, as its resulting formatting (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project
> conventions.

The codemod will handle _most_ but _not all_ of the breaking changes in v9. **Breaking changes
handled by the codemod are marked with 🤖 in the Upgrade Guide.**

**Please verify all changes made by the codemod.** As a safety precaution, we recommend committing
the changes from the codemod as a single isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can
roll back more easily if necessary.

## Component Deprecations

### Deprecation Types

#### Soft Deprecation

A soft-deprecated component is still available with its full functionality, but it will have been
renamed with a prefix to indicate its soft-deprecated status. It will also include a console warning
announcing its deprecation. This warning will only be triggered on the component's initial render.

Soft-deprecated types and utilities will also have been renamed but generally will not trigger a
console warning.

#### Hard Deprecation

A hard-deprecated component or package is no longer available. You will need to follow the method
prescribed in our Upgrade Guide to update your application. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) to our team
directly if you need additional help.

---

### Drawer

<!---
TODO: Please review this section with documenting SidePanel deprication
-->

We've [hard-deprecated](#hard-deprecation) `Drawer` and this component has been fully removed from
Canvas Kit. Consider using the
[Side Panel](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/preview-side-panel--basic). Be Aware
that `SidePanel` from the Main package is planned to be replaced by the one from Preview. We suggest
you use the Preview version of `SidePanel` until the one in Main is replaced with it.

---

### Layout and Column

`Layout` and `Column` components have been [hard-deprecated](#hard-deprecation) and are no longer
available in Canvas Kit. Please consider using
[`Grid`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-containers-grid--basic)
instead. While the `Grid` component is not a 1:1 replacement for `Layout`, it can be used in the
same way and offers several benefits over the deprecated components as a more robust and flexible
layout solution.

Please refer to
[the Examples section](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/examples-layouts--custom-column-positioning)
for ideas on how to replace the deprecated `Layout` component with the `Grid` component. This will
provide you with a deeper understanding of how to set custom column width or positioning using the
`Grid` component.

---

### Stack, HStack and vstack

We've hard deprecated the `Stack`, `HStack` and `VStack` components along with the props associated
to those components (`StackProps`, `HStackProps`, `VStackProps`, `StackStyleProps`). We recommend
using the `Flex` component and to replace the `spacing` prop with the `gap` prop. You can also run
`npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v9 [path]`.

> **Note**: If you are consuming `StackProps` for a custom component, please make sure to change the
> `spacing` prop to the `gap` prop

## Component Updates

### Buttons

We've changed the default `type` attribute of all our `buttons` to be `type="button"` instead of the
default `type="submit"`. This is a breaking change if you expected a button to submit by default.

We found an issue where the default action for `form` controls like `input` and `textarea` is to
click the first `submit` `button` which in some cases is not a `submit` button.

An example of this causing issues was our `Modal.CloseIcon` and `Modal.CloseButton`. When the
`Modal` is wrapped in a `form` element, the close icon would submit the `form`.

This change affects all of our `buttons` including:
`PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton, TertiaryButton, ToolbarButton`.

If you still wish for a specific `button` within a `form` to submit, just add the attribute
`type="submit"`.

### Toast

We've promoted `Toast` from Labs (`@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`) to the Main
(`@workday/canvas-kit-react`) package.

- This component is a
  [compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/).
- It has a `mode` prop that allows for proper accessibility attributes to be defined.
- Its sub components allow for more flexibility and access to lower level elements.

```tsx
// v8
<Toast actionText="View more details" onClose={handleClose}>Your workbook was successfully processed.</Toast>

// v9
<Toast mode="dialog">
  <Toast.Icon icon={checkIcon} color={colors.greenApple400} />
  <Toast.Body>
    <Toast.Message>Your workbook was successfully processed.</Toast.Message>
    <Toast.Link href="#hreflink">Custom Link</Toast.Link>
  </Toast.Body>
	<Toast.CloseIcon aria-label="Close" onClick={handleClose} />
</Toast>
```

🤖 The codemod will convert the `Toast` into a compound component with it's sub components having
the correct props.

> **Note**: If your Toast is a warning of some kind, you'll have to manually set the `mode` to
> `alert`.

## Utility Updates

### focusRing

We're removing memoization from focus ring. The `memoize` argument passed to `focusRing` is no
longer valid and we've removed the exported `memoizedFocusRing`. There is no codemod for this
change. We couldn't find any example of `memoize` or `memoizedFocusRing` being used.

### useTheme and getTheme

We've updated `useTheme` by adding error handling if this hook has been used outside a functional
component. Also, `getTheme` method has been added to access a theme from `styled` or class
components instead of `useTheme`.

### useCanvasTheme and getCanvasTheme

`useCanvasTheme` and `getCanvasTheme` have been removed as it's can be safely replaced by `useTheme`
and `getTheme` and there is no external usage of this functions found.

### useThemedRing

We've promoted `useThemedRing` from our Labs package to our Main package. You can use this utility
to theme focus rings.

🤖 The codemod will update the import for this utility.

### useThemeRTL

We've [soft-deprecated](#soft-deprecation) `useThemeRTL` from our Labs package. Although you may
still use this utility, we encourage consumers to use
[CSS logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties).

## Token Updates

### Depth

In v7, we released an update to our depth tokens that was too bold and harsh for web applications.
We've modified the depth token styles to be more subtle and improve visual design. This change
affects all components which use depth tokens including `Card`, `Toast`, `Dialog`, `Popup`, `Modal`,
and `Menu`. We have not changed which depth values each component references (i.e., `Card` remains
at `depth[1]`).
