# Canvas Kit 9.0 Upgrade Guide

This guide contains an overview of the changes in Canvas Kit v9. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you have
any questions.

- [Component Deprecations](#component-deprecations)
  - [Drawer](#drawer)
  - [Layout and Column](#layout-and-column) - [Stack](#stack-hstack-vstack)
- [Component Updates](#component-updates)
  - [Buttons](#buttons)

## Codemod

Please use our [codemod package](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod)
to automatically update your code to work with most of the breaking changes in v9.

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v9 [path]
```

Alternatively, if you're unable to run the codemod successfully using `npx`, you can install the
codemod package as a dev dependency, run it with `yarn`, and then remove the package after you're
finished.

```sh
> yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-codemod --dev
> yarn canvas-kit-codemod v9 [path]
> yarn remove @workday/canvas-kit-codemod
```

> The codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files. You'll need to manually edit
> other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.). You may need to run your linter after executing
> the codemod, as its resulting formatting (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project
> conventions.

The codemod will handle _most_ but _not all_ of the breaking changes in v9. **Breaking changes
handled by the codemod are marked with ðŸ¤– in the Upgrade Guide.**

**Please verify all changes made by the codemod.** As a safety precaution, we recommend committing
the changes from the codemod as a single isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can
roll back more easily if necessary.

## Component Deprecations

### Deprecation Types

#### Soft Deprecation

A soft-deprecated component is still available with its full functionality, but it will have been
renamed with a prefix to indicate its soft-deprecated status. It will also include a console warning
announcing its deprecation. This warning will only be triggered on the component's initial render.

Soft-deprecated types and utilities will also have been renamed but generally will not trigger a
console warning.

#### Hard Deprecation

A hard-deprecated component or package is no longer available. You will need to follow the method
prescribed in our Upgrade Guide to update your application. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) to our team
directly if you need additional help.

### Drawer

<!---
TODO: Please review this section with documenting SidePanel deprication
-->

We've [hard-deprecated](#hard-deprecation) `Drawer` and this component has been fully removed from
Canvas Kit. Consider using the
[Side Panel](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/preview-side-panel--basic). Be Aware
that `SidePanel` from the Main package is planned to be replaced by the one from Preview. We suggest
you use the Preview version of `SidePanel` until the one in Main is replaced with it.

---

### Stack, HStack and vstack

We've hard deprecated the `Stack`, `HStack` and `VStack` components along with the props associated
to those components (`StackProps`, `HStackProps`, `VStackProps`, `StackStyleProps`). We recommend
using the `Flex` component and to replace the `spacing` prop with the `gap` prop. You can also run
`npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v9 [path]`.

> **Note**: If you are consuming `StackProps` for a custom component, please make sure to change the
> `spacing` prop to the `gap` prop

---

### Menu in preview-react

We've removed the `Menu` component that was located in `preview-react`. `Menu` in `main` should be
used in place of the `Menu` in `preview-react`. Please see the
[Menu](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-popups-menu--basic) component in
`main`. To replace `Menu` in `preview-react` with the `Menu` component in `main` please see below:

Using the `DeprecatedMenu` and `DeprecatedMenuItem` component:

```tsx
import {DeprecatedMenu, DeprecatedMenuItem} from '@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react/menu';
import {
  Popup,
  usePopupModel,
  useAlwaysCloseOnOutsideClick,
  useReturnFocus,
  useCloseOnEscape,
} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/popup';

export const Basic = () => {
  return (
    <Popup model={model}>
      <Popup.Target>Open Menu</Popup.Target>
      <Popup.Popper placement="bottom-start">
        <DeprecatedMenu id={menuId} isOpen={isOpen} onClose={model.events.hide}>
          <DeprecatedMenuItem>First Item</DeprecatedMenuItem>
          <DeprecatedMenuItem>Second Item</DeprecatedMenuItem>
          <DeprecatedMenuItem>Third Item</DeprecatedMenuItem>
          <DeprecatedMenuItem>Fourth Item</DeprecatedMenuItem>
          <DeprecatedMenuItem>Fifth Item</DeprecatedMenuItem>
        </DeprecatedMenu>
      </Popup.Popper>
    </Popup>
  );
};
```

This will need to be updated to the below:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {Menu} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/menu';

export const Basic = () => {
  const [selected, setSelected] = React.useState('');
  return (
    <Menu onSelect={data => setSelected(data.id)}>
      <Menu.Target>Open Menu</Menu.Target>
      <Menu.Popper>
        <Menu.Card>
          <Menu.List>
            <Menu.Item>First Item</Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item>Second Item</Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item>Third Item (with a really, really, really long label)</Menu.Item>
            <Menu.Item>Fourth Item</Menu.Item>
          </Menu.List>
        </Menu.Card>
      </Menu.Popper>
    </Menu>
  );
};
```

> **Note**: There will be no codemod to replace this component due to varying differences in API and
> `Menu` is a compound component.

## Component Updates

### Buttons

We've changed the default `type` attribute of all our `buttons` to be `type="button"` instead of the
default `type="submit"`. This is a breaking change if you expected a button to submit by default.

We found an issue where the default action for `form` controls like `input` and `textarea` is to
click the first `submit` `button` which in some cases is not a `submit` button.

An example of this causing issues was our `Modal.CloseIcon` and `Modal.CloseButton`. When the
`Modal` is wrapped in a `form` element, the close icon would submit the `form`.

This change affects all of our `buttons` including:
`PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton, TertiaryButton, ToolbarButton`.

If you still wish for a specific `button` within a `form` to submit, just add the attribute
`type="submit"`.
