# Canvas Kit 6.0 Migration Guide

Below are the breaking changes made in Canvas Kit v6. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you have
any questions about the update.

- [Codemod](#codemod)
- [Component Deprecations](#component-deprecations)
  - [PageHeader](#page-header)

## Codemod

Please use our [codemod package](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod)
to automatically update your code to work with a majority of the breaking changes in the migration
from Canvas Kit v5 to v6. Simply run:

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v6 [path]
```

> Note: This codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` extensions. You may need to make
> some manual changes in other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.).

> Note: You may need to run your linter after executing the codemod, as it's resulting formatting
> (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project's styling.

**Breaking changes accounted for by this codemod will be marked with a ðŸ¤–.**

**Please verify all changes made by the codemod. As a safety precaution, we recommend committing the
changes from the codemod as a single isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can
rollback more easily if necessary.**

[Let us know](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you
encounter any issues or use cases that we've missed. The `@workday/canvas-kit-codemod` package will
help us maintain additional codemod transforms to make future migrations easier.

## Component Deprecations

### Page Header

We're beginning the deprecation process for `PageHeader` in favor of the `PageHeader` component provided by
UI-Platform. This component will still be available in v6, but it has been renamed to `DeprecatedPageHeader`
and log a warning message to the console when initially rendered. We plan to fully remove this component in Canvas Kit v7.
