## Codemod

Unlike past major releases, v10 does not have a codemod.

## Removals

Removals are deletions from our codebase which may no longer be consumed. We've either promoted or
replaced the removed component or utility.

## useBanner

We've removed the `useBanner` hook, the only function of which was to add `aria-labelledby` and
`aria-describedby` references to the text inside of the Banner. This was not required for
accessibility, and browsers can compute the name of the Banner from the text given inside.

## Deprecations

We add the [@deprecated](https://jsdoc.app/tags-deprecated.html) JSDoc tag to code we plan to remove
in a future major release. This signals consumers to migrate to a more stable alternative before the
deprecated code is removed.

### Input Icon Container

**PR:** [#2332](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2332)

We've deprecated `InputIconContainer` from [Main](#main) because it doesn't handle bidirectionality
or icons at the start of an input. Please use
[`InputGroup`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/components-inputs-text-input--icons)
instead.

---

### Table

**PR:** [#2344](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2344)

We've deprecated `Table` and `TableRow` and all of their exported members. Please use
[`Table in Preview`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/preview-table--basic) instead.

## Token Updates

### Space and Depth

**PR:** [#2229](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2229)

In v10, we have updated our `space` and `depth` token values from `px` to `rem`. This is based on
the default browser font size which is `16px`.

These updates just mean that we have moved the values from `px` to `rem`. The values have been
updated on a 1:1 basis. None of the base value have changed, just the unit.

Below is a table to show what each token value is, what is corresponds too and what the new `rem`
value is in `px`:

| px Value | rem Value | space Token |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0        | 0         | zero        |
| 4px      | 0.25rem   | xxxs        |
| 8px      | 0.5rem    | xxs         |
| 12px     | 0.75rem   | xs          |
| 16px     | 1rem      | s           |
| 24px     | 1.5rem    | m           |
| 32px     | 2rem      | l           |
| 40px     | 2.5rem    | xl          |
| 64px     | 4rem      | xxl         |
| 80px     | 5rem      | xxxl        |

You can convert a `px` value to a `rem` value by dividing your `px` value by `16`(if your default
browser font size hasn't been updated, the value will be `16`).

For example:

| Equation    | rem Value |
| ----------- | --------- |
| `16px/16px` | `1rem`    |
| `32px/16px` | `2rem`    |
| `8px/16px`  | `0.5rem`  |

#### Why Did We Make This Change?

We wanted to move away from absolute units in tokens to relative units for better accessibility and
adaptability to different viewport/screen sizes. If a user changes their default browser font size,
these sizes should change along with it. Since `px` are a fixed unit and do not scale, utilizing
`rem` will allow these tokens to scale with a new default font size.

## Component Updates

## Glossary

### Main

Our Main package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-react` has
undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for use in product.

Breaking changes to code in Main will only occur during major version updates and will always be
communicated in advance and accompanied by migration strategies.

---

### Preview

Our Preview package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at
`@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react` has undergone a full design and a11y review and is approved for
use in product, but may not be up to the high code standards upheld in the [Main](#main) package.
Preview is analagous to code in beta.

Breaking changes are unlikely, but possible, and can be deployed to Preview at any time without
triggering a major version update, though such changes will be communicated in advance and
accompanied by migration strategies.

Generally speaking, our goal is to eventually promote code from Preview to [Main](#main).
Occasionally, a component with the same name will exist in both [Main](#main) and Preview (for
example, see Segmented Control in [Preview](/components/buttons/segmented-control/) and
[Main](https://d2krrudi3mmzzw.cloudfront.net/v8/?path=/docs/components-buttons-segmented-control--basic)).
In these cases, Preview serves as a staging ground for an improved version of the component with a
different API. The component in [Main](#main) will eventually be replaced with the one in Preview.

---

### Labs

Our Labs package of Canvas Kit tokens, components, and utilities at `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`
has **not** undergone a full design and a11y review. Labs serves as an incubator space for new and
experimental code and is analagous to code in alpha.

Breaking changes can be deployed to Labs at any time without triggering a major version update and
may not be subject to the same rigor in communcation and migration strategies reserved for breaking
changes in [Preview](#preview) and [Main](#main).
