# Canvas Kit 10.0 Upgrade Guide

This guide contains an overview of the changes in Canvas Kit v10. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you have
any questions.

- [Token Updates](#token-updates)
  - [Space and Depth](#space-and-depth)

## Codemod

Please use our [codemod package](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod)
to automatically update your code to work with most of the breaking changes in v10.

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v10 [path]
```

Alternatively, if you're unable to run the codemod successfully using `npx`, you can install the
codemod package as a dev dependency, run it with `yarn`, and then remove the package after you're
finished.

```sh
> yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-codemod --dev
> yarn canvas-kit-codemod v10 [path]
> yarn remove @workday/canvas-kit-codemod
```

> The codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files. You'll need to manually edit
> other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.). You may need to run your linter after executing
> the codemod, as its resulting formatting (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project
> conventions.

The codemod will handle _most_ but _not all_ of the breaking changes in 10. **Breaking changes
handled by the codemod are marked with ðŸ¤– in the Upgrade Guide.**

**Please verify all changes made by the codemod.** As a safety precaution, we recommend committing
the changes from the codemod as a single isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can
roll back more easily if necessary.

## Token Updates

### Space and Depth

**PR:** [#2229](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2229)

In v10, we have updated our `space` and `depth` token values from `px` to `rem`. This is based on
the default browser font size which is `16px`.

These updates just mean that we have moved the values from `px` to `rem`. The values have been
updated on a 1:1 basis. None of the base value have changed, just the unit.

Below is a table to show what each token value is, what is corresponds too and what the new `rem`
value is in `px`:

| px Value | rem Value | space Token |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0        | 0         | zero        |
| 4px      | 0.25rem   | xxxs        |
| 8px      | 0.5rem    | xxs         |
| 12px     | 0.75rem   | xs          |
| 16px     | 1rem      | s           |
| 24px     | 1.5rem    | m           |
| 32px     | 2rem      | l           |
| 40px     | 2.5rem    | xl          |
| 64px     | 4rem      | xxl         |
| 80px     | 5rem      | xxxl        |

You can convert a `px` value to a `rem` value by dividing your `px` value by `16`(if your default
browser font size hasn't been updated, the value will be `16`).

For example:

| Equation    | rem Value |
| ----------- | --------- |
| `16px/16px` | `1rem`    |
| `32px/16px` | `2rem`    |
| `8px/16px`  | `0.5rem`  |

#### Why Did We Make This Change?

We wanted to move away from absolute units in tokens to relative units for better accessibility and
adaptability to different viewport/screen sizes. If a user changes their default browser font size,
these sizes should change along with it. Since `px` are a fixed unit and do not scale, utilizing
`rem` will allow these tokens to scale with a new default font size.
