# Canvas Kit 15.0 Upgrade Guide

This guide contains an overview of the changes in Canvas Kit v15. Please
[reach out](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you have
any questions.


## Why You Should Upgrade

v15.0 and v4.0 Canvas Tokens Web introduces new shape, size, gap, and padding tokens to our components. While we still support our old shape and
space tokens, the new tokens aim to add more semantic meaning to allow for better use and theming.

> **Note:** While v15 and v4 tokens should be backwards compatible with previous versions that use
> CSS tokens, we strongly advise to migrate both Canvas Kit and Canvas Tokens Web together.
