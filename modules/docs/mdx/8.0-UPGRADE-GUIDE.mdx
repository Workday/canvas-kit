## Codemod

Please use our [codemod package](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/codemod)
to automatically update your code to work with many of the breaking changes as you upgrade from
Canvas Kit v6 to v7:

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v7 [path]
```

> Note: This codemod only works on `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` extensions. You may need to make
> some manual changes in other file types (`.json`, `.mdx`, `.md`, etc.).

> Note: You may need to run your linter after executing the codemod, as its resulting formatting
> (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project's styling.

**Breaking changes handled by this codemod will be marked with a ðŸ¤–.**

**Please verify all changes made by the codemod. As a safety precaution, we recommend committing the
changes from the codemod as a single isolated commit (separate from other changes) so you can
rollback more easily if necessary.**

[Let us know](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you
encounter any issues or use cases that we've missed.

## Components

### Box

#### Updating props

The following props have been added to the `Box` component to support font and text styles:
`fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontStyle`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`, `textAlign`,
`textDecoration`, `textTransform`, `textShadow`, `whiteSpace`, `wordBreak`.

```tsx
// v7
const StyledBox = styled(Box)({
  fontFamily: 'monospace',
  fontSize: type.properties.fontSizes[16],
  fontWeight: type.properties.fontWeights.medium
})

<StyledBox />

// v8
<Box fontFamily="monospace" fontSize={16} fontWeight="medium" />
```
