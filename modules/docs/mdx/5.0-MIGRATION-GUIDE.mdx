## General Changes

### Canvas Kit CSS Maintenance Mode

Due to the infrequent use of our CSS modules, they will be going into maintenance mode in Canvas Kit
v5. We will still support `@workday/canvas-kit-css` with bug fixes and significant visual updates,
but it generally won't be receiving new components, additional features, etc. This will allow us to
provide more focused support, and dedicate our efforts to making bigger and better improvements to
our most used components: Canvas Kit React. If you have questions or concerns, please
[let us know](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=&template=question.md).

### Codemod

We've provided a [new codemod package](./modules/codemod) that you can use to update the majority of
the v5 breaking code changes. Simply run:

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v5 [path]
```

> Note: This codemod only work on .js, .jsx, .ts, and .tsx extensions. You may need to make some
> manual changes in other file types (.json, .mdx, .md, etc.).

> Note: You may need to run your linter after executing the codemod, as it's resulting formatting
> (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project's styling.

Breaking changes accounted for by this codemod will be marked with a 🤖.

Please [let us know](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if
you have any troubles or missed use cases with this codemod. The `@workday/canvas-kit-codemod`
package will help us maintain additional codemod transforms to make future migrations easier.

### Rename Core and Labs Core Modules to Tokens

The distinction between our core and common packages is often unclear and creates confusion around
what should be imported from where. To help alleviate this and better align with our design
taxonomy, we're renaming our `core` packages to `tokens`. We are also removing the `type` default
\export the labs core package in favor of named imports. These changes are listed below; all of
which are handled by the v5 codemod.

#### Automatic Updates

- 🤖 Core import statements
- e.g. `import { space } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/core';` becomes
  `import { space } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';`
- 🤖 Labs core import statements
- e.g. `import { type } from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/core';` becomes
  `import { type } from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/tokens';`
- 🤖 Labs core default type import
- e.g. `import type from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/core';` becomes
  `import { type } from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/tokens';`

### Slash Imports

We have moved from a separate module for every component to a slash imports system. All of our react
components are now bundled under three packages:

- `@workday/canvas-kit-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react`

Due to this change, imports will need to be updated. For example:

```tsx
// before
import canvas from '@workday/canvas-kit-react';
import Button from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';

// after
import canvas from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';
import {Button} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button';
```

This change is covered by the codemod, but it doesn't currently run on files that don't use the
`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` extensions. Those files will have to be updated manually.

### Space Tokens

To better align with our design taxonomy, we are renaming our space tokens in our core package. We
will also no longer rely on `@workday/canvas-space-web` to supply our space values. Instead, we are
keeping the values in canvas-kit. We also took the opportunity to improve the space types (which
were too generic) and JSDoc hints.

The codemod will handle _almost all_ of these changes with a few possible exceptions that will be
noted in [Manual Updates](#manual-updates) below.

```tsx
// before
import { spacing, spacingNumbers CanvasSpacingValue } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-core';

// after
import { space, spaceNumbers, CanvasSpaceValues } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';
```

This table describes each update:

| Before                | After                     | Change Description               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `spacing`             | `space`                   | name change only                 |
| `spacingNumbers`      | `spaceNumbers`            | name change only                 |
| `CanvasSpacing`       | `CanvasSpace`             | name change and improved types\* |
| `CanvasSpacingValue`  | `CanvasSpaceValues`       | name change only                 |
| `CanvasSpacingNumber` | `CanvasSpaceNumbers`      | name change and improved types\* |
| `n/a`                 | `CanvasSpaceNumberValues` | new type!                        |

\* Before the types were too generic and not very useful. They now better reflect the values they
represent.

#### Automatic Updates

- 🤖 Token imports: `spacing`, `spacingNumbers`
  - e.g. `import { spacing, spacingNumbers }` becomes `import { space, spaceNumbers }`
- 🤖 Type imports: `CanvasSpacing`, `CanvasSpacingValue`, `CanvasSpacingNumber`
  - e.g. `import { CanvasSpacing, CanvasSpacingValue, CanvasSpacingNumber }` becomes
    `import { CanvasSpace, CanvasSpaceValues, CanvasSpaceNumbers }`
- 🤖 Token expressions
  - e.g. `const iconPadding = spacing.s;` becomes `const iconPadding = space.s`
- 🤖 Type expressions
  - e.g. `const getSpace = (value: CanvasSpacingValue) => ( spacing[value] )` becomes
    `const getSpace = (value: CanvasSpaceValue) => ( space[value] )`
- 🤖 Token properties
  - e.g. `const iconPadding = canvas.spacing.s;` becomes `const iconPadding = canvas.space.s`

#### Manual Updates

As previously mentioned, the codemod should handle the vast majority of these updates. But there are
potentially a few changes that will need to be made manually. There may be more beyond what's listed
below, but these were the most common issues found in our investigation.

- Usage outside of `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files
  - e.g. referencing `spacing` in documentation (`.md` files)
- Usage in code comments or JSDoc comments
  - e.g. `// spacing.s = 16px`
- Re-declararation `space` or `spaceNumbers` in the same files = e.g. importing or declaring a new
  `space` or `spaceNumbers` variable will prevent the codemod from updating the file
- Aliasing existing variables as `spacing` or `spaceNumbers`
  - e.g. `import { spacingNumbers as spacing }` will prevent the codemod from updating the file

### Compound Components

Components are transitioning to [Compound Components](./COMPOUND_COMPONENTS.md)

- Components will support [forwarded refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html)
- The corresponding tag of a component can be changed with the `as` prop

### Canvas Kit Preview & Component Promotions

Due to the broad range of stability in Canvas Kit Labs (`@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`), we are
introducing a new module called "Canvas Kit Preview" (`@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react`) to
provide consumers with more clarity and confidence when uptaking experimental and upcoming
components. The components in Canvas Kit Preview have had a full design and accessibility review,
and are approved for use in product. Their functionality and design are set, but the API's and/or
underlying architecture could still be subject to change. This bundle serves as a staging ground for
components that are ready to use, but may not be up to the high code standards upheld in the main
`@workday/canvas-kit-react` bundle. For more info, check out the
[Canvis Kit Preview README](../../preview-react/README.md).

Generally, Canvas Kit Preview components were originally in [Canvas Kit Labs](../../labs-react) and
have been promoted. Essentially, Canvas Kit Labs is for alpha components and Canvas Kit Preview is
for beta components.

We have promoted several components that were previously in Canvas Kit Labs into Canvas Kit Preview
and our main `@workday/canvas-kit-react` module:

#### `@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react`

- Breadcrumbs
- Color Picker
- Core `type` > Tokens `type`
- Menu
- Select
- Side Panel

#### `@workday/canvas-kit-react`

- Pagination
- Tabs

## Breaking Component Changes

### Input Ref Forwarding

All input components in the main package now support
[ref forwarding](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) using the standard `ref` attribute.
This includes:

- Checkbox
- Color Input
- Color Preview
- Radio
- Select
- Switch
- Text Input
- Text Area

Additionally, the Select in Preview (formerly in Labs) has also been updated to support ref
forwarding.

Most of these input components previously supported an `inputRef` prop that could be used to obtain
a ref to the component's underlying input element. For example, in v4, if you wanted to obtain a ref
to a Text Input's underlying `<input type="text" />` element, you could pass a ref to the component
using `inputRef`. In v5, you'll need to use `ref` instead of `inputRef` (or run the codemod 🤖):

```tsx
const ref = React.useRef(null);
// before
<TextInput inputRef={ref} />;
// after
<TextInput ref={ref} />;
```

🤖 The codemod will update all input components that previously supported `inputRef` to use `ref`
instead.

For components that previously supported `inputRef`, `ref` is now forwarded to the same underlying
element that `inputRef` was applied to previously. Select and Select (Preview) did not support
`inputRef` in v4, but now support `ref` in v5. See each component's documentation for information on
which element `ref` is forwarded to for that particular component.

Input component prop interfaces no longer extend directly from their underlying element interface
(e.g., `TextInputProps` no longer extends from `React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>`).
`createComponent` returns a component that determines the element interface via the `as` prop. This
is why input component props no longer contain an element interface directly. If you extend from an
input component prop interface, or have code that uses an input component prop interface and
accesses properties like `onClick`, you'll have to provide the input attribute yourself. This is not
code-moddable since intent cannot be pre-determined. This will not effect runtime, but only
TypeScript.

```tsx
interface MyTextInputProps extends TextInputProps {}

// onClick no longer exists in `TextInputProps` so TypeScript will complain about onClick not
// existing in `MyTextInputProps` (onClick does exist as a prop on `<TextInput>`, however)
const MyTextInput = ({onClick}: MyTextInputProps) => <TextInput onClick={onClick} />;

// Fix
interface MyTextInputProps extends TextInputProps, React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {}

// Alternate fix
interface MyTextInputProps extends TextInputProps {
  onClick?: React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLInputElement>;
}
```

As a final note, the following input components were previously class components and, thus,
technically supported the `ref` attribute in v4:

- Color Input
- Color Preview
- Select
- Select (Preview)
- Text Input
- Text Area

Passing `ref={ref}` to any of these components in v4 would have set `ref.current` to the mounted
instance of the entire component
([source](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#accessing-refs)) rather than the underlying
HTML element represented by the component. This is no longer the case in v5.

### Button

#### Recategorization

There has been common confusion around the large number of buttons Canvas supports and when each
should be used. To improve the usability of our design system, we have been working to recategorize
and simplify our button offering. To align with the changes recently made in our Figma libraries, we
have reorganized our buttons, renaming a few and removing some others. The majority of button use
cases have been simplified into three different components: `PrimaryButton`, `SecondaryButton`, and
`TertiaryButton`, each level representing its emphasis and hierarchy in a UI. We hope this makes
your usage of our buttons more intentional and clear. We have provided a codemod to make all of
these changes automatic updates. In addition, the `SecondaryButton` now uses the "outline" styling
by default for improved accessibility.

**Renamed:**

- 🤖 `Button` has been split into `PrimaryButton` and `SecondaryButton` (depending on the `variant`
  prop).
- 🤖 `OutlineButton` (`secondary`) is now `SecondaryButton`. For accessibility reasons, the
  `outline` styling is the new styling for our secondary buttons.
- 🤖 `OutlineButton` (`inverse`) is now `SecondaryButton` with an `inverse` variant.
- 🤖 `TextButton` is now `TertiaryButton`.

**Removed:**

- 🤖 `HighlightButton`. Use `SecondaryButton` instead.
- 🤖 `OutlineButton` with `primary` variant. Use `PrimaryButton` or `SecondaryButton` instead. The
  codemod will replace with `SecondaryButton`.
- 🤖 `DropdownButton`. This can be achieved simply using `PrimaryButton` or `SecondaryButton` with
  an `icon` prop and `iconPosition="right"`.

To see examples of the before and after code, have a look at our
[codemod tests](../../codemod/lib/v5/spec/recategorizeButtons.spec.ts).

#### Exports

Additionally, we have changed some of the button module's export behavior:

- 🤖 `beta_Button` export was removed. The codemod will rename the import to `Button` instead,
  preserving local renaming if it exists.
  ```tsx
  // before
  import {beta_Button as Button} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';
  // after
  import {SecondaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';
  ```
- 🤖 The default export was removed. The codemod will change default imports to named imports.
  ```tsx
  // before
  import Button from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';
  // after
  import {SecondaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';
  ```
- 🤖 Enums have been removed from all buttons. String literals are used instead. The codemod will
  write any usages of an enum to the string literal. If you used an enum as a type, the codemod will
  expand to a union of string literals. You could change the union manually instead to be something
  like `SecondaryButtonProps['variant']` if you prefer not to duplicate the union of string
  literals.
  ```tsx
  // before
  <Button size={Button.Size.Large} />;
  interface Props {
    size: ButtonSize;
  }
  // after
  <SecondaryButton size="large" />;
  interface Props {
    size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  }
  ```
- Buttons now use `createComponent` utility from the `common` module which now forwards `ref` and
  allows `as` to change the underlying element.

  - 🤖 `buttonRef` was renamed to `ref` provided by `createComponent`. `buttonRef` is no longer
    valid. The codemod will rewrite all instances of `buttonRef` to `ref` for any JSX element that
    is a Button import from Canvas-Kit.
    ```tsx
    // before
    <Button buttonRef={ref}>
    // after
    <SecondaryButton ref={ref}>
    ```
  - Button prop interfaces no longer extend directly from the
    `React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>`. `createComponent` returns a component that
    determines the element interface via the `as` prop. This is why Button props no longer contain
    an element interface directly. If you extend from a Button prop interface, or have code that
    uses a Button prop interface and accesses properties like `onClick`, you'll have to provide the
    button attribute yourself. This is not code-moddable since intent cannot be pre-determined. This
    will not effect runtime, but only Typescript.

    ```tsx
    // before
    interface MyButtonProps extends ButtonProps {}

    // onClick no longer exists on `ButtonProps`, but does exist as a prop in `<Button>`
    const MyButton = ({children, onClick}: MyButtonProps) => (
      <SecondaryButton onClick={onClick}>{children}</Button>
    );

    // after
    interface MyButtonProps extends ButtonProps, React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {}

    // OR
    interface MyButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
      onClick?: React.MouseEventHandler<HTMLButtonElement>;
    }
    ```

### Card

🤖 `Card` is now a compound component. The card is now composed of a `Card.Body` and an optional
`Card.Heading`. This allows direct access to the header and body elements.

```tsx
// before
<Card header="Card Title" headerId="header-id">
  Card Body
</Card>

// after
<Card>
  <Card.Heading id="header-id">Card Title</Card.Heading>
  <Card.Body>Card Body</Card.Body>
</Card>
```

The codemod will do its best to rewrite the JSX to match the new API. It will work if you rename
`Card` in the import or use style via `styled(Card)`. It will not work in cases where `header` or
`headerId` are used in a spread props. Here's some examples:

```tsx
// WORKS

// default import
import Card from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-card'

<Card header="Card Title">Card Body</Card>

// renamed import
import { Card as CanvasCard } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-card'

<CanvasCard header="Card Title">Card Body</CanvasCard>

// styled card
import {Card} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-card'

const StyleCard = styled(Card)(styles)

<StyledCard header="Card Title">Card Body</StyledCard>

// DOES NOT WORK

// spread props
import {Card} from '@workday-canvas-kit-card'

const props = {
  header: 'Card Title'
}
<Card {...props}>Card Body</Card>

// re-exporting
import {Card} from './Card' // where `Card` is a re-exported Canvas `Card`
```

This codemod should handle most of what we've seen in code that uses Canvas Kit cards already.

### InputProvider

The `InputProvider` wrapper component (used to provide css-referencable data attributes for the
users current input method) has been moved. After renaming our `core` package to `tokens`, it no
longer made sense in this location.

- 🤖 `InputProvider` moved from `@workday/canvas-kit-react-core` to
  `@workday/canvas-kit-react/common`.

### Tabs

- `onTabsChange` is now `onActivateTab` and the signature is now:
  ```tsx
  function onActivateTab({data: {tab: string}, state: TabsState}): void;
  ```
- The `<Tabs>` component no longer accepts the `currentTab` property. The Tabs uses a model now. See
  story for more details
- As noted above, Tabs has been promoted out of Canvas Kit Labs. You can now import directly from
  `@workday/canvas-kit-react/tabs`.

### Labs Space Style Function

The `space` style function in the `/labs-react/token` (formerly `labs/core`) has been removed.
Please opt to use `Box` instead. Below is an example:

```tsx
// before
import {spaceNumbers} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-core';
import {space} from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react-core';
// A styled div with space props
const Box = styled('div')(space);

<Box p={spaceNumbers.xl}>Ye Olde SpaceBox</Box>;

// after
import {Box} from '@workday/canvas-kit/labs-react/common';

// You can also use `padding={spaceNumbers.xl}` or `padding={space.xl}`
<Box padding="xl">New Box</Box>;
```

### Popper

Popper used to render an empty `div` element as a child of the element created by the `PopupStack`.
`ref` and `elemProps` (extra props) applied to that element. Now `ref` applies to the element
created by the `PopupStack` and `elemProps` don't get applied to anything. The `PopupStack` is not
React-specific and there is no easy way to spread extra props onto this element like other
components do. The `ref` still points to that element, so you can add anything extra to that `ref`
via DOM APIs if necessary. There is no codemod for this change.

### Border Radius Zero Token

The border radius zero token value was updated from `0` to `"0px"` for consistency; all other border
radius tokens use string pixel values. We highly doubt this change will cause any issues, but
because the value's type is different, this is technically a breaking change.

```tsx
// before
import {borderRadius} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';

console.log(borderRadius.zero); // returns `0`

// after
import {borderRadius} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';

console.log(borderRadius.zero); // returns "0px"
```

### Popups

`Popup` has transitioned to a compound component, along with all Popup-base behavior hooks. What was
a `Popup` Provider to v5 is now a `Popup.Card` in v5. The target button and `Popper` components have
been moved to subcomponents of a `Popup`.

**Before**

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import {Button, DeleteButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';
import {
  Popper,
  Popup,
  usePopup,
  useCloseOnEscape,
  useCloseOnOutsideClick,
} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-popup';

export const MyPopup = () => {
  const {targetProps, closePopup, popperProps, stackRef} = usePopup();

  useCloseOnOutsideClick(stackRef, closePopup);
  useCloseOnEscape(stackRef, closePopup);

  const onDeleteClick = () => {
    closePopup();
    console.log('Delete');
  };

  return (
    <>
      <DeleteButton {...targetProps}>Delete Item</DeleteButton>
      <Popper placement={'bottom'} {...popperProps}>
        <Popup
          width={400}
          heading={'Delete Item'}
          padding={Popup.Padding.s}
          handleClose={closePopup}
        >
          <p>Are you sure you'd like to delete the item titled 'My Item'?</p>

          <DeleteButton onClick={onDeleteClick}>Delete</DeleteButton>
          <Button onClick={closePopup}>Cancel</Button>
        </Popup>
      </Popper>
    </>
  );
};
```

**After**

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import {DeleteButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button';
import {
  Popup,
  usePopupModel,
  useCloseOnEscape,
  useCloseOnOutsideClick,
  useInitialFocus,
  useReturnFocus,
} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/popup';

export const MyPopup = () => {
  const model = usePopupModel();

  useCloseOnOutsideClick(model);
  useCloseOnEscape(model);
  useInitialFocus(model); // new
  useReturnFocus(model); // new

  const onDeleteClick = () => {
    console.log('Delete');
  };

  return (
    <Popup model={model}>
      <Popup.Target as={DeleteButton}>Delete Item</Popup.Target>
      <Popup.Popper placement={'bottom'}>
        <Popup.Card width={400} padding="s">
          <Popup.CloseIcon aria-label="Close" />
          <Popup.Heading>Delete Item</Popup.Heading>
          <Popup.Body>
            <p>Are you sure you'd like to delete the item titled 'My Item'?</p>

            <Popup.CloseButton as={DeleteButton} onClick={onDeleteClick}>
              Delete
            </Popup.CloseButton>
            <Popup.CloseButton>Cancel</Popup.CloseButton>
          </Popup.Body>
        </Popup.Card>
      </Popup.Popper>
    </Popup>
  );
};
```

The most notable changes is `Popup` is now a container component that takes a `PopupModel` and has
several subcomponents like `Popup.Target` and `Popup.CloseButton`. These components are hooked up to
the `PopupModel` via React context and have access to state and events. `Popup.Card` is what the v4
`Popup` once was.

All behavior hooks, like `useCloseOnEscape` now take a `model` instead of variable parameters. This
allowed us to fix some subtle bugs where visibility of the Popup wasn't originally known to the
behavior hooks. Using the `PopupModel` means all hooks have access to all Popup state and events
without passing in many parameters.

In the above example, `usePopup` has been removed. `usePopupModel` should be used instead. All
subcomponents have an associated behavior hook. For example, `Popup.Target` uses a hook called
`usePopupTarget`. If you need to use your own components for any reason, these hooks are available.
`Popup.Target` and `Popup.CloseButton` do not include any styling. They both use `SecondaryButton`
as the default component rendered. You can change this via the `as` prop. For example, the following
will render an unstyled button:

```tsx
<Popup.Target as="button">Show</Popup.Target>
```

Pass a `css` prop, or a styled button instead to have a custom styled button. You could even pass
`IconButton` if you need an icon button to show a popup instead!

If you were using `usePopup`, here's a list of equivalent APIs:

| Before                                                                  | After                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `const { popperProps, targetProps, closePopup, stackRef } = usePopup()` | `const model = usePopupModel()`       |
| `popperProps.open`                                                      | `model.state.visibility !== 'hidden'` |
| `closePopup()`                                                          | `model.events.hide()`                 |
| `stackRef` or `popperProps.ref`                                         | `model.state.stackRef`                |
| `popperProps.anchorElement`                                             | `model.state.targetRef.current`       |
| `targetProps.onClick`                                                   | `usePopupTarget(model).onClick`       |

A common theme we noticed in uses of Popup in the wild was focus management. Developers were
manually passing a `ref` to the target button element and manually returning focus to it when
closing a Popup through whatever means it was closed. This use-case should be handled now by a new
hook: `useReturnFocus`. By default, `useReturnFocus` will return focus to the `targetRef` in the
model, which is set by `Popup.Target`. This can be overridden via `returnFocusRef` passed to the
model on creation. This `returnFocusRef` might make some migrations easier if `Popup.Target` cannot
be used for whatever reason.

```tsx
// before
const {closePopup} = usePopup();

// passed to some event handler
const closeAndReturnFocus = () => {
  closePopup();
  buttonRef.current.focus();
};

// after
const model = usePopupModel({
  returnFocusRef: buttonRef, // only use if you cannot use `Popup.Target`
});

useReturnFocus(model);
```

Another common focus thing to do is to focus something within a popup when the popup is shown. The
`useInitialFocus` was created for this purpose. `useInitialFocus` will set focus on the first
focusable element when the popup becomes visible. This behavior can be overridden by setting the
`initialFocusRef` in the model.

```tsx
// before
const {stackRef, popperProps} = usePopup();

useLayoutEffect(() => {
  if (!open) {
    return;
  }

  stackRef.current.querySelector('input,...').focus();
}, [popperProps.open]);

// after
const model = usePopupModel({
  initialFocusRef: someRef, // only use if you want to explicitly focus on something. Could be useful for an input.
});

useInitialFocus(model);
```

If you use your own positioning and only need to use the original `Popup`, you can use `Popup.Card`
instead. Without the model and behaviors, the following is equivalent:

```tsx
// before
<Popup width={width} handleClose={onClose} heading="Popup Heading">
  Popup Content
</Popup>

// after
<Popup.Card with={width}>
  <Popup.CloseIcon aria-label="Close" onClick={onClose} />
  <Popup.Heading>Popup Heading</Popup.Heading>
  <Popup.Body>Popup Content</Popup.Body>
</Popup.Card>
```

`Popup.Card` is using `Card`, which is now using `Box`. This means changes to some props:

| Before                         | After                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `padding={Popup.Padding.zero}` | `padding="zero"` or `padding={space.zero}` |
| `depth={depth[0]}`             | `depth={0}`                                |
| `popupRef={ref}`               | `ref={ref}`                                |
