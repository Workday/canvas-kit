## General Changes

### Canvas Kit CSS Maintenance Mode

Due to the infrequent use of our CSS modules, they will be going into maintenance mode in Canvas Kit v5. We will still support `@workday/canvas-kit-css` with bug fixes and significant visual updates, but it generally won't be receiving new components, additional features, etc. This will allow us to provide more focused support, and dedicate our efforts to making bigger and better improvements to our most used components: Canvas Kit React. If you have questions or concerns, please [let us know](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=&template=question.md).

### Slash Imports

We have moved from a separate module for every component to a slash imports system. All of our react components are now bundled under two packages:
- `@workday/canvas-kit-react`
- `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`

Due to this change, imports will need to be updated. For example:
```tsx
// before
import canvas from '@workday/canvas-kit-react';
import Button from '@workday/canvas-kit-react-button';

// after
import canvas from "@workday/canvas-kit-react/core";
import { Button } from "@workday/canvas-kit-react/button";
```

We've provided a [new codemod package](./modules/codemod) that you can use to update the majority of your imports. Simply run:

```sh
> npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod v5 [path]
```
> Note: This codemod only work on .js, .jsx, .ts, and .tsx extensions. You may need to make some manual changes in other file types (.json, .mdx, .md, etc.).

> Note: You may need to run your linter after executing the codemod, as it's resulting formatting (spacing, quotes, etc.) may not match your project's styling.

Please [let us know](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug.md) if you have any troubles or missed use cases with this codemod. The `@workday/canvas-kit-codemod` package will help us maintain additional codemod transforms to make future migrations easier.

### Compound Components

Components are transitioning to [Compound Components](./COMPOUND_COMPONENTS.md)
- Components will support [forwarded refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html)
- The corresponding tag of a component can be changed with the `as` prop

## Breaking Component Changes

### Tabs

- `onTabsChange` is now `onActivateTab` and the signature is now:
  ```tsx
  function onActivateTab({data: {tab: string}, state: TabsState}): void;
  ```
- The `<Tabs>` component no longer accepts the `currentTab` property. The Tabs uses a model now. See
  story for more details
