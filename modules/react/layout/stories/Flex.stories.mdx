# Canvas Kit Flex

`Flex` is a low-level layout component that provides a common, ergonomic API for building
one-dimensional layouts with
[CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox).

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Usage} />

### Rows and Columns

You can nest `Flex` components to build layouts with rows and columns.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FlexLayout} />

### Small Containers

You can also use `Flex` to create layouts within smaller containers, such as this card example
below:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FlexCard} />

### Flex vs. Box

`Flex` is built with `Box` and has access to all `BoxProps`. The main differences between `Box` and
`Flex` are:

- `Flex` is set to `display: flex` by default
- The `display` prop is limited to `flex` and `inline-flex`
- `Flex` has access to flex container properties.

In short, use `Flex` when you need a flex container to build layouts with CSS Flexbox, and use `Box`
when you need a simple container. It's also important to note that `Flex` has no real opinion about
how to build layouts outside of the CSS Flexbox spec. Its unopinonated nature allows it to be
composed into many different components.

## Flex Props

As previously mentioned, `Flex` is built on top of `Box` and has access to all its props, including
[flex item properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Item). But `Flex` adds
[flex container properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Container)
through style props as well. There are seven flex container props:
