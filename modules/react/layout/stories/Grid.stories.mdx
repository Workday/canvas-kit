# Canvas Kit Grid

`Grid` is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and
columns [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids).

If you want to see how Flexbox and Grid can
[work together](https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-replace-flexbox/).

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Examples

### Rows and Columns

You can nest `Grid` components to build layouts with rows and columns. You can also nest `Grid`
components within `<Grid.Item/>` components for even more possibilities.

In the below example, we have a `Grid` container which has a green border. It contains six elements
and one of them is called `Child`. This is to show how the `<Grid.Item/>` component functions. In
the layout, the `Child` element, is the third element in the layout however, with the `<Grid.Item/>`
component, it allows a user to use child specific props for that component. The `Child` element
below is using the `gridRowStart='1'` prop to be placed first in the order.

In the second example below, we have a `Grid` container which has a red-orange border. It contains
two rows with one having seven elements and the other has two elements. This example is to show how
a user can use the `<Grid.Item/>` component to wrap a `<Grid/>` component. This would allow a user
to have access to the child props of `<Grid.Item/>` to place a layout where needed. The row with
elements 3 - 7 is put before the 1 & 2 elements since that layout is wrapped by the `<Grid.Item/>`
component.

### UI Layout Example

<!-- ### Small Containers

You can also use `Grid` to create layouts within smaller containers, such as this card example
below:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={GridCard} /> -->

### Grid vs. Box

`Grid` is built with `Box` and has access to all `BoxProps`. The main differences between `Box` and
`Grid` are:

- `Grid` is set to `display: grid`, `inline-grid` or `subgrid` by default.
- The `display` prop is limited to `grid`, `inline-grid` and `subgrid`.
- `Grid` has access to grid container properties.
- `Grid.Item` has access to grid child properties.

In short, use `Grid` when you need a grid container to build layouts with CSS Grid, and use `Box`
when you need a simple container. It's also important to note that `Grid` has no real opinion about
how to build layouts outside of the CSS Grid spec. Its unopinonated nature allows it to be composed
into many different components.

## Grid Props

As previously mentioned, `Grid` is built on top of `Box` and has access to all its props, including
[grid container properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout#the_grid_container)
through style props as well. There are seven grid container props:
