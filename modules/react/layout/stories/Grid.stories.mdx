# Canvas Kit Grid

`Grid` is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and
columns. [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids).

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Example

### Basic Example

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Example} />

### Rows and Columns

You can nest `Grid` components to build layouts with rows and columns.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={GridLayout} />

### Small Containers

You can also use `Grid` to create layouts within smaller containers, such as this card example
below:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={GridCard} />

### Grid vs. Box

`Grid` is built with `Box` and has access to all `BoxProps`. The main differences between `Box` and
`Grid` are:

- `Grid` is set to `display: grid` by default
- The `display` prop is limited to `grid`, `inline-grid` and `subgrid`
- `Grid` has access to grid container properties.

In short, use `Grid` when you need a grid container to build layouts with CSS Grid, and use `Box`
when you need a simple container. It's also important to note that `Grid` has no real opinion about
how to build layouts outside of the CSS Grid spec. Its unopinonated nature allows it to be composed
into many different components.

## Grid Props

As previously mentioned, `Grid` is built on top of `Box` and has access to all its props, including
[grid container properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout#the_grid_container)
through style props as well. There are seven grid container props:

<ArgsTable of={GridStyle} />
