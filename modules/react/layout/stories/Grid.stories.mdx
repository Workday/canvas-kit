# Canvas Kit Grid

`Grid` is a low-level layout component that provides a common, ergonomic API for building
two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns) with
[CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids).

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

> **Note**: We recommend you familiarize yourself with
> [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids) before diving into
> our `Grid` component. This example makes use of
> [Grid Areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Grid_Areas).

In this example, we set up a basic layout built with `Grid` using four child components: `Header`,
`SideBar`, `BodyContent` and `Footer`. By assigning the same names to each child's `gridArea` prop,
we're able to arrange them by referencing their names in the parent `Grid` container. Our example
uses a 12-column grid with `SideBar` occupying three columns and `BodyContent` occupying the
remaining nine.

Below is a basic layout built with `Grid`. We created four components: `Header`, `SideBar`,
`BodyContent` and `Footer`. We also used those names for their respective `gridArea` props. Then we
can use those names in the parent component, `UIExample`, to organize the UI however we want. This
allows the parent container to control how its children render. For page layouts, Workday typically
uses a 12 column grid. In the example below, the Sidebar is 3 columns and the Body Content is 9
columns.

### Using Grid Items

In the example above we nested `Grid` components to create our layout, and we controlled the layout
structure from the top-level `Grid` container. We can also use `Grid.Item` components to allow child
cells to have more control. While any direct child of a `Grid` component is implicitly a grid item,
`Grid.Item` provides special CSS Grid Item style props that allow you to have more control over how
and where each item renders.

To demonstrate this behavior, the example below has a `Grid` container with nine cells. The eight
`soap500` cells are `Grid` components, and the `peach300` cell is a `Grid.Item`. We can use the
`Grid.Item` style props `gridRowStart` and `gridColumnStart` to manipulate where the cell renders.
Use the `Row` and `Column` buttons to manipulate these props and see the `Grid.Item`'s position
adjust accordingly.

> **Note**: This example is solely intended to demonstrate `Grid.Item`'s functionality and is
> **not** considered an accessibility best practice. Visually reordering content does not change the
> tab order or the order it is read in by a screen reader. Learn more about
> [CSS Grid layout and accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_Layout_and_Accessibility).

<ExampleCodeBlock code={GridLayoutInteractive} />

Let's look at another `Grid.Item` example. Below, we have a `Grid` container with two rows: one with
seven elements and another with two elements. Each row is a `Grid.Item` that wraps a nested `Grid`.
This allows you to use `Grid.Item` to place a layout where needed. Here, we use `gridRowStart` to
place the row with elements 3 through 7 before the row with elements 1 and 2.

### Grid vs. Flex vs. Box

`Grid` and `Flex` are built on top of `Box`, so they have access to all `BoxProps`. Additionally,
`Grid` and `Flex` have their own specific style props that map to CSS Grid and Flexbox properties,
respectively. When using these components to build layouts, it is not a matter of choosing `Grid`
_or_ `Flex` _or_ `Box`, but rather deciding how to
[use them together](https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-replace-flexbox/). They are intended to be
complementary not exclusionary. With that said, here are general guidelines for when to use which:

- Use `Grid` for **two-dimensional** layouts (rows AND columns).
- Use `Flex` for **one-dimensional** layouts (a row OR a column).
- Use `Box` for generic containers that don't need CSS Flexbox or Grid.

## Components

### Grid

`Grid` is a container component for creating two-dimensional layouts with CSS Grid. It has special
style props that map to CSS Grid style properties to provide a common, ergonomic API for building
layouts.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Grid grid gridTemplateColumns="1fr 2fr 1fr" gridGap={space.s}>
  <div>Implicit grid item 1</div>
  <div>Implicit grid item 2</div>
  <div>Implicit grid item 3</div>
</Grid>
```

#### Props

As previously mentioned, `Grid` is built on top of `Box` and has access to all its props, including
[grid container properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout#the_grid_container)
through style props as well.

<ArgsTable of={GridStyle} />

### Grid.Item

`Grid.Item` is a subcomponent of Grid. It has specific grid item style props that map to CSS Grid
Item properties. This provides greater control over how child components render in your layout.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Grid gridGap={space.s}>
  <Grid.Item gridColumn="1 / span 2">First item</Grid.Item>
  <Grid.Item gridRow="1 / span 2">Second item</Grid.Item>
  <Grid.Item gridColumn="1 / span 2" gridRow="2">
    Third item
  </Grid.Item>
</Grid>
```

#### Props

<ArgsTable of={GridItemStyle} />
