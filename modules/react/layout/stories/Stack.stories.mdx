# Canvas Kit Stack

`Stack`, `HStack`, and `VStack` are higher-level layout components that provide an ergonomic API for
building one-dimensional layouts with consistent spacing between elements. They're built on top of
`Flex` and have access to all `FlexProps` and `BoxProps`. `Stack` can align items in either a
horizontal or vertical orientation. `HStack` and `VStack` will only align items in a horizontal or
vertical orientation, respectively.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

`Stack` is a higher-level layout component, meaning:

1. It's built on top of lower-level components (`Box` and `Flex`)
2. It's opinionated about how it builds layouts.

`Stack` has three core opinions that guide its API:

- Space should be equal between child elements
- Space should only exist between child elements
- Children should be semantic elements

Much of layout design is founded on these opinions. Whether its creating lists of navigation links,
groups of cards, or collections of buttons, once you think in stacks, you'll see them everywhere.

### Basic Example

`Stack` is a composable component that's helpful for creating layouts with equal spacing between
elements. It can create horizontal or vertical stacks of elements.

> The most important distinction to make with `Stack` is that it is _not a grid._ Grid components
> are able to align items along two dimensions (rows and columns), and `Stack` is only built to
> support one dimension (rows _or_ columns). That said, you can nest horizontal and vertical `Stack`
> components to create grid-like layouts.

`Stack` uses CSS pseudo-classes to apply margin to child elements. This makes it really simple to
get consistent spacing between child elements without much manual effort. Below is a basic example.
Note that `Stack` does not add any space above or below the child elements. This helps your element
fit nicely within their containers.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BasicStack} />

Use this approach when:

- You want consistent space between child elements
- You don't need to apply custom margin to child elements
  - Specifically `marginLeft`/`marginInlineStart` for horizontal stacks and `marginTop` for vertical
    stacks
- You don't want to add extra markup to wrap child elements

#### Setting Direction

The direction of the child elements is set with the `flexDirection` prop. This prop supports four
directions: `column`, `column-reverse`, `row`, and `row-reverse`. By default, it will set the
direction to `row` as is consistent with the CSS Flexbox spec.

> Note: `flex-direction` and other CSS Flexbox attributes support bidirectionality (LTR and RTL)
> automatically. You don't need to think about switching directions for localization.

> Note: `spacing` also supports bidirectionality automatically. This means you don't need to think
> about it for localization as long as you properly pass the `direction` to the `theme` object un

#### Setting Space

The space between child elements is set with the `spacing` prop, which supports all space token and
string values. `Stack` intentionally only sets space between elements and never outside. For
example: a vertical stack of three elements would only have margin added to the top of the second
and third child elements. Keeping space between elements makes building layouts more block-like and
predictable.

#### Managing Child Elements

There are three ways to manage space between child elements with `Stack`.

- Implicit spacing applied directly to child elements (default behavior)
- Implicit wrapping child elements with `shouldWrapChildren`
- Explicit wrapping child elements with `Stack.Item`s.

Each approach has its own benefits and limitations, which are discussed in further detail below. We
chose to implicitly apply spacing to child elements as the default behavior because it requires the
least overhead to implement and should support most use cases. The other approaches act as escape
hatches for when the default behavior becomes forced. Should you find none of these approaches work
for your use case, we recommend using `Flex` instead of `Stack`, which will provide you with more
flexibility.

#### Valid Children

Because `Stack` applies styles to children, it requires its immediate children to be valid child
elements. For example, text outside of an HTML tag would not render if it was an immediate `Stack`
child. Here's an example snippet:

```tsx
const ValidChildrenExample = () => {
  return (
    <Stack flexDirection="row" spacing="s">
      This text will not render. Don't do this.
      <p>This text will render.</p>
      <span>This text will also render.</span>
    </Stack>
  );
};
```

### Grid-like Layouts

You can nest vertical and horizontal `Stack`s to create grid-like layouts. Here are three horizontal
`Stack`s nested within a vertical `Stack`. The fourth row is a single `Flex` component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={NestedStacks} />

### Small Containers

You can also use `Stack` to manage smaller layouts, such as within Cards.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={StackCard} />

### HStack

`HStack` works identically to `Stack` but is limited to only `row` and `row-reverse` directions. It
defaults to `row` if no `flexDirection` is provided.

> Note: `HStack` supports bidirectionality automatically. This means that you won't need to switch
> the direction or spacing for localization. The direction switching is handled by the CSS Flexbox
> spec, and the spacing will flip direction based on the `direction` provided in the `theme` object.

In this example, `HStack` is placing three cards in a row with small spacing between them.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={HStackCards} />

### VStack

`VStack` works identically to `Stack` but is limited to only `column` and `column-reverse`
directions. It defaults to `column` if no `flexDirection` is provided.

In this example, `VStack` is placing three cards in a column with small spacing between them.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={VStackCards} />

### shouldWrapChildren and Stack.Item

A side-effect of `Stack`'s pseudo-classes is an increased style specificity. This specificity can
override the child element's margin styles. If that creates a problem, there are two recommended
options available:

- Use the `shouldWrapChildren` prop (implicit option)
- Use `Stack.Item` (explicit option)

#### shouldWrapChildren

The `shouldWrapChildren` prop will implicitly wrap each child in a `Stack.Item` component (which is
a `Box`) and apply the margin to it instead of the child element provided. This allows you to
control the margin of the child elements you provide and avoiding style collisions. The trade-off is
that you do not have direct access to the `Stack.Item` being rendered. If having access to that
element is necessary, using `Stack.Item` explicitly (as described below) could be the best solution.

The example below is a bit contrived but has enough information to convey the point. In this
scenario, we have a horizontal stack of `SecondaryButton`s that render an icon, but they are
visually divided into separate groupings. The navigational buttons are on the left, and the
additional actions are spaced slightly further to the right. You could use two separate horizontal
stacks here to achieve the same result, but you could also use `shouldWrapChildren` and then put
additional margin only where needed. Either approach would be fine; it's a matter of personal
preference.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ShouldWrapChildren} />

Use this approach when:

- You want consistent space between child elements
- You need to apply custom margin to particular children
- Wrapping each child element won't create issues with other semantic elements
- You don't want to explicitly add extra markup to wrap child elements

#### Stack.Item

Sometimes inserting implicit wrapper elements can be problematic when you need access to those
elements. In those situations, `shouldWrapChildren` is not the best choice, and you should opt for
wrapping children in `Stack.Item`s. A `Stack.Item` is a `Box` with some preset styles which can be
overridden if needed.

In the example below, we wanted to keep our `li` elements as direct children of the `ul` stack. So
we're wrapping each of the links with `Stack.Item`s, casting them as `li`s and applying custom
styles to each. This would not be possible with `shouldWrapChildren`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={StackItems} />

Use this approach when:

- You want consistent space between child elements
- You need to have direct access to `Stack.Item` wrappers
- Wrapping each child element won't create issues with other semantic elements
