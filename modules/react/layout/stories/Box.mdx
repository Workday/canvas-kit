# Box

`Box` is a primitive component that provides a common, ergonomic API around Canvas design tokens. It
is highly flexible, and its primary purpose is to build other components.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

## Props

### The `As` Prop

The `as` prop allows you to override the underlying element of a component or combine it with
another component. By default, `Box` will render a `div` element, but sometimes that's not what you
want. Below, we have a `Box` that we want to render as a semantic anchor element. The most
noticeable transformation is that `Box` renders as a link. But also notice that while it still
supports all `BoxProps` such as `padding`, it also supports semantic anchor element props such as
`href`.

### Style Props

`Box` exposes [style props](/get-started/for-developers/documentation/style-props/) that allow you
to modify styles in an ergonomic way across components. To learn more about individual sets of `Box`
style props, consult the lists below.
