# createContainer

When building a component that has a model, you typically start with a container component.
`createContainer` is a utility function that hooks up all the pieces for you.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

- It will wrap your component in a context provider so that `subComponents` have access to the
  model.
- It attaches your model hook to your component
- It runs any `elemPropsHook` hooks defined
- You can attach `subComponents`.
- It will also extract the element attributes and define the `ref` type based on the element you
  give it.

```tsx
import {createContainer} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';
interface DisclosureProps {}

//... useDiscloseModel

export const Disclosure = createContainer('div')({
  displayName: 'Disclosure',
  modelHook: useDisclosureModel,
})<DisclosureProps>(({children, ...elemProps}, Element, model) => {
  return (
    // spread div attributes including ref
    <Element {...elemProps}>{children}</Element>
  );
});
```
