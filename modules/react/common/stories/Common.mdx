# Common
The Common package contains a collection of components and utilities that serve as the foundation for building robust features across other packages.

## Base

The `Base` component is a low level component that automatically handles the [`cs`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--docs#cs-prop) prop for you and style merging via [`handleCsProp`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-merging-styles--docs#handlecsprop).
As we transition away from supporting `Box` and `Flex` due to their support of [style props](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/features-style-props--docs), `Base` is recommended when needing a container element where simple styles need to be applied.

### Transitioning from `Box` and `Flex` to `Base`

> `Box` and `Flex` where great, why are you moving away from them?

To be more specific, _style props_ are going away. And because `Box`, `Flex`, and `Grid` primarily exist to expose style props, they will almost certainly be removed as well.

The two main reasons for this change:
- Emotion’s runtime for dynamic styling is very expensive, and with the improvements to CSS, we can no longer justify that cost.
- Moving to static styling allows us to export our styles to Canvas Kit CSS so teams who do not use React can have 1:1 styling with what’s available in Canvas Kit React.

**Before, using Flex**

```tsx
import {Flex} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/layout';
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';
import {PrimaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button';
//...

<Flex flexDirection='row' gap={system.space.x2}>
  <PrimaryButton>Button 1</PrimaryButton>
  <PrimaryButton>Button 2</PrimaryButton>
</Flex>
```

**After, using Base**

```tsx
import {Base} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';
import {PrimaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button';
//...

<Base cs={{display: 'inline-flex', gap: system.space.x2}}>
  <PrimaryButton>Button 1</PrimaryButton>
  <PrimaryButton>Button 2</PrimaryButton>
</Base>
```
