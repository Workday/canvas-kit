# Common
The Common package contains a collection of components and utilities that serve as the foundation for building robust features across other packages.

## Base

The `Base` component is a low level component that automatically handles the [`cs`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--docs#cs-prop) prop for you and style merging via [`handleCsProp`](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-merging-styles--docs#handlecsprop).
As we transition away from supporting `Box` and `Flex` due to their support of [style props](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/features-style-props--docs), `Base` is recommended when needing a container element where simple styles need to be applied.
