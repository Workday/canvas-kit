# Combobox

Combobox is an _abstract_ compound component - it should not be used on its own, but used as a base
to create combobox components. The Combobox system provides components, models, loaders, and
elemProps hooks.

The term "Combobox" is based on the
[Combobox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/) as defined in the ARIA
Authoring Practices Guide (APG):

> A [combobox](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#combobox) is an input widget with an associated popup
> that enables users to select a value for the combobox from a collection of possible values.

Examples of a "combobox" would be date pickers, autocomplete, and select components.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Autocomplete

This example shows an Autocomplete example using `FormField`, `InputGroup`, and the `Combobox`
components to make an autocomplete form field. It uses `useComboboxLoader` to make mock API calls
using `setTimeout`. Your application may use
[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API),
[WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), or other means of
communicating with a server.
