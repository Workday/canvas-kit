# Combobox

Combobox is an abstract compound component. The term "Combobox" is based on the
[Combobox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/) as defined in the ARIA
Authoring Practices Guide (APG):

> A [combobox](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#combobox) is an input widget with an associated popup
> that enables users to select a value for the combobox from a collection of possible values.

Autocomplete and Select are examples of a Combobox and these components should be used instead.
