# Canvas Kit Toast

`Toast` is a [compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/)
that contains updates or messages about the status of an application's process.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`Toast` includes a container `Toast` component and the following subcomponents: `Toast.Body`,
`Toast.CloseIcon`, `Toast.Icon`, `Toast.Message`, and `Toast.Link`.

`Toast` supports different modes through the `mode` prop: `status`, `alert`, and `dialog`. Each mode
conveys a different purpose of the message and assigns the necessary ARIA attributes to support that
purpose and provide an accessible experience.

By default, `mode` is set to `status`, which indicates the message contains advisory information
such as a successful action.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

A `status` `Toast` will wrap the message within a `polite` ARIA live region with a `role` of
`status`.

### Alert

Set the `mode` prop to `alert` to convey urgent and important information such as an error.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ToastAlert} />

An `alert` `Toast` will wrap the message within an `assertive` ARIA live region with a `role` of
`alert`.

### Dialog

Set the `mode` prop to `dialog` to convey the presence of a follow-up action. If you use this
`mode`, you need to add an `aria-label`. This `aria-label` should be additional information for the
`Toast`. The `Toast` will also add an `aria-describedby` that links the `Toast` to `Toast.Message`
so that it is read out to screen readers. The `aria-label` should be different that the contents of
the `Toast` so there is no duplication being read out by screen readers.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ToastDialog} />

Screen readers will read it out in the following order: "Notifcation: Your workbook was successfully
processed."

> **Note**: You must use the `Toast.Message` subcomponent when the `mode` is `dialog` so that `id`
> is tied to the message for accessibility. You can also pass in a `model` with `useToastModel` to
> provide a specific `id` for the `Toast.Message`

```tsx
export const CustomIDToast = () => {
  const model = useToastModel({
    id: '12df5',
    mode: 'dialog',
  });
  return (
    <Toast model={model}>
      <Toast.Icon icon={checkIcon} color={colors.greenApple400} />
      <Toast.Body>
        <Toast.Message>Your workbook was successfully processed.</Toast.Message>
        <Toast.Link href="#href">View More Details</Toast.Link>
      </Toast.Body>
    </Toast>
  );
};
```

### Right-to-Left (RTL)

`Toast` supports right-to-left languages when specified in the `CanvasProvider` `theme`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTL} />
