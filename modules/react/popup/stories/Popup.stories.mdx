# Canvas Kit Popups

A "popup" is a classification for a type of stacked UI element that appears "on top" of statically
positioned content. Tooltips, Modals, Dropdown menus, etc are all examples of "popups". Canvas Kit
has a "stack manager" system for managing these popups. Different types of popups have different
requirements of behavior for UX and accessibility - we can call them behaviors, capabilities, or
traits. Canvas Kit comes with a number of [behavioral hooks](#hooks) in the form of React Hooks.

You should use the most semantic component for your use-case before using `Popup` directly, like
`Modal`, which already has the correct behaviors built-in. If no component already exists that
matches your use case, you can use `Popup` and use our [hooks](#hooks). The `Popup` component comes
with a `Popup.Popper` subcomponent that positions a popup using [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/)
that registers a popup with the `PopupStack` automatically and sets the popup model's `placement`
property. `Popup.Popper` component and hooks work with the stack management system for correct
rendering and accessibility behavior. If you cannot use `Popup.Popper`, use the
[usePopupStack](#usepoupstack) hook to properly register and deregister the popup at the correct
time. If you cannot use our hooks, consider upgrading your component to use Hooks. If you cannot do
that, you'll have to look up the `PopupStack` package for the direct API and have a look at the
source code for our hooks into the `PopupStack` API.

This package comes with everything you need to build Popup UIs.

[Buttons](/components/buttons/button)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

The `Popup` component is a generic
[Compound Component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/) that is used to
build popup UIs that are not already covered by Canvas Kit.

### Basic Example

The Popup has no pre-defined behaviors built in, therefore the `usePopupModel` must always be used
to create a new `model`. This `model` is then used by all behavior hooks to apply additional popup
behaviors to the compound component group. The following example creates a typical popup around a
target element and adds `useCloseOnOutsideClick`, `useCloseOnEscape`, `useInitialFocus`, and
`useReturnFocus` behaviors. You can read through the [hooks](#hooks) section to learn about all the
popup behaviors. For accessibility, these behaviors should be included most of the time.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Initial Focus

If you want focus to move to a specific element when the popup is opened, set the `initialFocusRef`
of the model. Check with accessibility before doing this. The following example sets the focus on
the "OK" button with an `aria-describedby` pointing to the model's `id` state so screen readers
properly announce the message of the popup when focus is changed to the button. By default, focus
will be placed on the first focusable element when the popup is opened.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={InitialFocus} />

### Focus Redirect

Focus management is important to accessibility of popup contents. The following example shows
`useFocusRedirect` being used to manage focus in and out of a Popup. This is very useful for
Dialog-style popups. Since `Popup.Popper` renders contents to the bottom of the document body,
`aria-owns` is used for screen readers that support it. This effectively treats a Popup like it
exists in between the buttons while it is opened. Screen readers will navigate the content as if the
content was not portalled to the bottom of the document body. Focus redirection tries to treat the
Popup as if it were inline to the document. Tabbing out of the Popup will close the Popup and move
focus to the next appropriate element.

> **Note**: Safari does not support `aria-owns`. This means that the contents of the Popup will
> appears out of order to Safari + VoiceOver users. We render popups at the bottom of the
> document.body to ensure proper rendering. You could use `portal=false` on the `Popper` component,
> but that would risk incorrect rendering in all browsers.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FocusRedirect} />

### Focus Trapping

Focus trapping is similar to the [Focus Redirect](#focus-redirect) example, but will trap focus
inside the popup instead of redirecting focus, it will be trapped inside the Popup. This is most
useful for modal dialogs where the modal must be interacted with before normal interaction can
continue.

> **Note**: Using focus trapping outside a Modal context can give users a different experience
> depending on how they interact with your application. Focus trapping will not prevent mouse users
> from breaking out of a focus trap, nor will it prevent screen reader users from using virtual
> cursors from breaking out. Modals should use additional techniques to truely "trap" focus into the
> Popup to provide a consistent experience for all users.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FocusTrap} />

### Multiple Popups

If you need multiple Popups within the same component, you can create multiple models and pass a
unique model to each Popup. Below is an example of 2 different popups within the same component.
Since each Popup gets its own model, each Popup behaves independently. The same technique can be
used for nested Popups.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={MultiplePopups} />

### Nested Popups

If you need nested Popups within the same component, you can create multiple models and pass a
unique model to each Popup. Popup comes with a `Popup.CloseButton` that uses a `Button` and adds
props via the `usePopupCloseButton` hook to ensure the popups hides and focus is returned. The `as`
can be used in a powerful way to do this by using `<Popup.CloseButton as={Popup.CloseButton}>` which
will mix in click handlers from both popups. This is not very intuitive, however. You can create
props that merge a click handler for both Popups by using `usePopupCloseButton` directly. The second
parameter is props to be merged which will effectively hide both popups. Focus management is
preserved.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={NestedPopups} />

### Custom Target

It is common to have a custom target for your popup. Use the `as` prop to use your custom component.
The `Popup.Target` element will add `onClick` and `ref` to the provided component. Your provided
target component must forward the `onClick` to an element for the Popup to open. The `as` will cause
`Popup.Target` to inherit the interface of your custom target component. This means any props your
target requires, `Popup.Target` now also requires. The example below has a `MyTarget` component that
requires a `label` prop.

> **Note**: If your application needs to programmatically open a Popup without the user interacting
> with the target button first, you'll also need to use `React.forwardRef` in your target component.
> Without this, the Popup will open at the top-left of the window instead of around the target.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomTarget} />

### RTL

The Popup component automatically handles right-to-left rendering.

> **Note:** This example shows an inaccessible open card for demonstration purposes.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTL} />

## Components

### Popper

A thin wrapper component around the Popper.js positioning engine. For reference:
https://popper.js.org/. `Popper` also automatically works with the `PopupStack` system. `Popper` has
no UI and will render any children to the `body` element and position around a provided
`anchorElement`.

Prefer using [Popup.Popper](#popuppopper) instead. Use this to make Popups that don't utilize a
PopupModel or any associate popup [hooks](#hooks).

> **Note:** `Popper` renders any children to a `div` element created by the `PopupStack`. This
> element is not controlled by React, so any extra element props will _not_ be forwarded. The `ref`
> will point to the `div` element created by the `PopupStack`, however. In v4, an extra `div`
> element was rendered and that's where extra props were spread to. In v5+, you can provide your own
> element if you wish.

### Popup

This component is a container component that has no semantic element. It provides a React Context
model for all Popup subcomponents. If you manually pass a `model` to all subcomponents, this
container component isn't needed.

```tsx
// using Popup
<Popup model={model}>
  <Popup.Target /> // no model here
</Popup>

// using models on subcomponents
<>
  <Popup.Target model={model} />
</>
```

<ArgsTable of={Popup} />

### Popup.Target

A `Popup.Target` is any element that is meant to show the Popup. The default component rendered by
this component is a `SecondaryButton` element. You can override this by passing the desired
component via `as`. Many examples above use `as={DeleteButton}`. If you want to render an
`IconButton` instead, use `as={IconButton}`. The behavior hook used is called `usePopupTarget`.

```tsx
const model = usePopupModel();

// using this component
<Popup.Target>Show Popup</PopupTarget>

// using props instead
const popupTargetButtonProps = usePopupTarget(model);
<SecondaryButton {...popupTargetButtonProps}>Show Popup</SecondaryButton>
```

`Popup.Target` doesn't provide any styling by default. All styling comes from the default component
used, which is `SecondaryButton`. If you don't want any styling, you can do the following:

```tsx
<Popup.Target as="button">Open</Popup.Target>
```

To add your own styling, you could either add a `css` prop, or make a styled button and pass that
styled component via the `as` prop.

### Popup.Popper

A `Popup.Popper` is a [Popper](#popper) component that is hooked up to the `PopupModel`
automatically. The behavior hook used is called `usePopupPopper`.

> **Note:** `Popup.Popper` renders any children to a `div` element created by the `PopupStack`. This
> element is not controlled by React, so any extra element props will _not_ be forwarded. The `ref`
> will point to the `div` element created by the `PopupStack`, however. If you wish to add extra
> props to an element, add them to the `Popup.Card` instead.

<ArgsTable of={Popup.Popper} />

### Popup.Card

A `Popup.Card` is a wrapper around the `Card` component, but hooked up to a `PopupModel`. By
default, this element has a `role=dialog` and an `aria-labelledby`. The behavior hook used is called
`usePopupCard`.

<ArgsTable of={Popup.Card} />

### Popup.CloseButton

A `Popup.CloseButton` is a button that will hide a popup. By default, this is a `SecondaryButton`
component, but `as` can be used to render any button element (i.e `<DeleteButton>` or
`<PrimaryButton>`). The behavior hook used is called `usePopupCloseButton`.

<ArgsTable of={Popup.CloseButton} />

### Popup.CloseIcon

A `Popup.CloseIcon` is an icon button that is the `X` in the top of a popup. It will hide a popup
when clicked. The behavior hook used is called `usePopupCloseButton`.

<ArgsTable of={Popup.CloseIcon} />

### Popup.Heading

A `Popup.Heading` is a wrapper around `Card.Heading` that connect the heading to a `PopupModel`. It
will add an `id` to the element that match the `aria-labelledby` that is applied to the `Popup.Card`
element for accessibility. The behavior hook used is called `usePopupHeading`.

<ArgsTable of={Popup.Heading} />

### Popup.Body

A `Popup.Body` is a thin wrapper around `Card.Body` and doesn't actually take a model. It adds
`body` styling and nothing else.

<ArgsTable of={Popup.Body} />

## Model

The PopupModel contains all state and events needed for Popup behaviors and components. It composes
a `DisclosureModel` for showing and hiding content.

### Config

<ArgsTable of={PopupModelConfigComponent} />

### State

<ArgsTable of={PopupStateComponent} />

### Events

<ArgsTable of={PopupEventsComponent} />

## Hooks

### usePopupStack

```ts
const stackRef = usePopupStack(forwardRef?: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>): React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement>
```

> **Note:** If you're using `Popper`, you do not need to use this hook directly.

This hook will add the `stackRef` element to the Popup stack on mount and remove on unmount. If you
use `Popper`, the popper `stackRef` is automatically added/removed from the Popup stack. The Popup
stack is required for proper z-index values to ensure Popups are rendered correct. It is also
required for global listeners like click outside or escape key closing a popup. Without the Popup
stack, all popups will close rather than only the topmost one.

If `forwardRef` is provided, it will be the same as `stackRef`. If `forwardRef` is not provided,
this hook will create one and return it.

This hook should be used by all popups unless using the `Popper` component.

Example:

```tsx
const model = usePopupModel();
usePopupStack(model.state.stackRef, model.state.targetRef);

// add some popup functionality
useCloseOnOutsideClick(model);
useCloseOnEscape(model);

return (
  <>
    <button ref={model.state.targetRef}>Open Popup</button>
    {model.state.visibility !== 'hidden'
      ? ReactDOM.createPortal(<div>Popup Contents</div>, model.state.stackRef.current)
      : null}
  </>
);
```

### useAssistiveHideSiblings

```ts
useAssistiveHideSiblings(model: PopupModel): {}
```

This hook will hide all sibling elements from assistive technology. Very useful for modal dialogs.
This will set `aria-hidden` for sibling elements of the provided PopupModel's `state.stackRef`
element and restore the previous `aria-hidden` to each component when the component is unmounted.
For example, if added to a Modal component, all children of `document.body` will have an
`aria-hidden=true` applied _except_ for the provided `stackRef` element (the Modal). This will
effectively hide all content outside the Modal from assistive technology including Web Rotor for
VoiceOver for example.

This should be used on popup elements that need to hide content (i.e. Modals).

### useBringToTopOnClick

```ts
useBringToTopOnClick(model: PopupModel): {}
```

This hook will bring an element to the top of the stack when any element inside the provided
PopupModel's `state.stackRef` element is clicked. If `Popup.Popper` was used or `PopupStack.add`
provided an `owner`, all "child" popups will also be brought to the top. A "child" popup is a Popup
that was opened from another Popup. Usually this is a Tooltip or Select component inside something
like a Modal.

This should be used on popup elements that are meant to persist (i.e. Windows).

### useCloseOnEscape

```ts
useCloseOnEscape(model: PopupModel): {}
```

Registers global detection of the Escape key. It will only call the PopupModel's `hide` event if the
provided model's `state.stackRef` element is the topmost in the stack.

This should be used with popup elements that are dismissible like Tooltips, Modals, non-modal
dialogs, dropdown menus, etc.

### useCloseOnOutsideClick

```ts
useCloseOnOutsideClick(model: PopupModel): {}
```

Registers global listener for all clicks. It will only call the PopupModel's `hide` event if the
click happened outside the PopupModel's `state.stackRef` element and its children _and_ the provided
`stackRef` element is the topmost element with this behavior applied in the stack. Adds a
`data-behavior-click-outside-close="topmost"` attribute to ensure proper functionality.

This should be used with popup elements that are dismissible like Modals, non-modal dialogs,
dropdown menus, etc. Tooltips and hierarchical menus should use `useAlwaysCloseOnClickOutside`
instead.

### useAlwaysCloseOnOutsideClick

```ts
useAlwaysCloseOnOutsideClick(model: PopupModel): {}
```

Registers global listener for all clicks. It will only call the PopupModel's `hide` event if the
click happened outside the `stackRef` element and its children regardless of the position in the
stack. This is useful for Tooltips or hierarchical menus. Adds a
`data-behavior-click-outside-close="always"` attribute to ensure proper functionality.

This should be used with popup elements that should close no matter their position in the stack
(i.e. Tooltips).

### useDisableBodyScroll

```ts
useDisableBodyScroll(model: PopupModel): {}
```

Disables body scroll by adding `overflow: hidden` to the body element. This effectively prevents
page scrolling while the popup is visible.

This should be used with popup elements that hide all other content and force the user to accept or
dismiss the popup before continuing (i.e. Modals).

### useFocusRedirect

```ts
useFocusRedirect(model: PopupModel): {}
```

Manages focus around a popup, treating the popup as if it was part of the DOM where it appears.
Popups are typically "portalled" (inserted at the end of `document.body`) to ensure proper
rendering. This violates
[WCAG Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html).
This hook helps redirect focus as if the popup element appeared in the DOM. `aria-owns` might also
be used to ensure assistive technology places the popup after the button for virtual cursors. This
hook does no provide `aria-owns` and this must be provided yourself. Requires
[useReturnFocus](#usereturnfocus) to work properly. Works well with
[useInitialFocus](#useinitialfocus).

This should be used with non-modal dialogs.

### useFocusTrap

```ts
useFocusTrap(model: PopupModel): {}
```

"Trap" or "loop" focus within a provided `stackRef` element. This is required for accessibility on
modals. If a keyboard users hits the Tab or Shift + Tab, this will force "looping" of focus. It
effectively "hides" outside content from keyboard users. Use an overlay to hide content from mouse
users and `useAssistiveHideSiblings` to hide content from assistive technology users. Works well
with [useInitialFocus](#useinitialfocus) and [useReturnFocus](#usereturnfocus).

This should be used on popup elements that need to hide content (i.e. Modals).

### useInitialFocus

Moves focus within the popup when the popup becomes visible. This is useful for keyboard and screen
reader users alike. This should be used with [useFocusRedirect](#usefocusredirect) or
[useFocusTrap](#usefocustrap) for a complete focus management solution.

This should be used for popups that have focusable elements inside, like Modals, non-modal dialogs,
menus, etc.

### useReturnFocus

Returns focus to the target element when the popup is hidden. This works well with
[useInitialFocus](#useinitialfocus). This should be used with [useFocusRedirect](#usefocusredirect)
or [useFocusTrap](#usefocustrap) for a complete focus management solution.

This should ble used on popup elements that use [useInitialFocus](#useinitialfocus).

### usePopupPopper

```ts
usePopupPopper(model: PopupModel, elemProps: {}, ref: React.Ref<any>): {}
```

Adds the necessary props to a `Popper` component. Used by the [Popup.Popper](#popuppopper)
subcomponent.

### usePopupCard

```ts
usePopupCard(model: PopupModel, elemProps: {}, ref: React.Ref<any>): {}
```

Adds the necessary props to a `Card` component. Used by the [Popup.Card](#popupcard) subcomponent.

### usePopupCloseButton

```ts
usePopupCloseButton(model: PopupModel, elemProps: {}, ref: React.Ref<any>): {}
```

Adds the necessary props to a close button component. Used by the
[Popup.CloseButton](#popupclosebutton) subcomponent and [Popup.CloseIcon](#popupcloseicon)
subcomponent.

### usePopupHeading

```ts
usePopupHeading(model: PopupModel, elemProps: {}, ref: React.Ref<any>): {}
```

Adds the necessary props to a `Heading` component. Used by the [Popup.Heading](#popupheading)
subcomponent.

### usePopupTarget

```ts
usePopupTarget(model: PopupModel, elemProps: {}, ref: React.Ref<any>): {}
```

Adds the necessary props to a `Target` component. Used by the [Popup.Target](#popuptarget)
subcomponent.
