# Canvas Kit Modal

A Modal component is a type of Dialog that renders a translucent overlay that prevents user
interaction with the rest of the page. A Modal will render the rest of the page inert until the
Modal is dismissed. A Modal should be used when the user needs to presented with important
information that must be interacted with before continuing interaction with the rest of the page.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic

The basic behavior of a modal is to hide all content from all users that is "behind" the modal
dialog.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Without Close Icon

If you wish to remove the close icon button, you can simply omit the `Modal.CloseButton`
subcomponent. If you have a modal dialog that requires the user to accept instead of dismiss though
an escape key or clicking outside the modal, you must create a new `PopupModel` without those
behaviors and hand that model to the Modal dialog component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithoutCloseIcon} />

### Custom Focus

By default, the Modal makes sure the first focusable element receives focus when the Modal is
opened. Most of the time, this is the `Modal.CloseIcon` button. If that element isn't present, the
Modal will use the Modal Heading to make sure screen reader users have focus near the start of the
Modal's content. This allows screen reader users to discover the Modal's content more naturally
without having to navigate back up again. Sometimes, it is a better user experience to focus on a
different element. The following example shows how `initialFocusRef` can be used to change which
element receives focus when the modal opens.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomFocus} />

### Custom Target

It is common to have a custom target for your modal. Use the `as` prop to use your custom component.
The `Modal.Target` element will add `onClick` and `ref` to the provided component. Your provided
target component must forward the `onClick` to an element for the Modal to open. The `as` will cause
`Modal.Target` to inherit the interface of your custom target component. This means any props your
target requires, `Modal.Target` now also requires. The example below has a `MyTarget` component that
requires a `label` prop.

> **Note**: If your application needs to programmatically open a Modal without the user interacting
> with the target button first, you'll also need to use `React.forwardRef` in your target component.
> Without this, the Modal will open at the top-left of the window instead of around the target.

## Components

### Modal

This component is the container component and does not render any semantic elements. It provides a
React Context model for the `Modal` subcomponents. If you manually pass a `model` to all
subcomponents, this container component isn't needed. If you do not pass a `model`, the `Modal`
container component will build a default one using `useModalModel`. `Modal` is a composition of a
`Popup` component and has a similar structure to `Popup`.

### Modal.Target

A `Modal.Target` is any element that is meant to show the Modal. The default component rendered by
this component is a `SecondaryButton` element. You can override this by passing the desired
component via `as`. Many examples above use `as={DeleteButton}`. If you want to render an
`IconButton` instead, use `as={IconButton}`. The `Modal.Target` is an alias for `Popup.Target` and
uses the `usePopupTarget` hook.

### Modal.Overlay

A `Modal.Overlay` is the component that hooks a Modal up to the `PopupStack` as well as the
semi-transparent overlay commonly used with modals. Internally, the `Modal.Overlay` component uses
two `div` elements to ensure proper rendering of the `Modal` content.
