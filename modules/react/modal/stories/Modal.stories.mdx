# Canvas Kit Modal

A Modal component is a type of Dialog that renders a translucent overlay that prevents user
interaction with the rest of the page. A Modal will render the rest of the page inert until the
Modal is dismissed. A Modal should be used when the user needs to presented with important
information that must be interacted with before continuing interaction with the rest of the page.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic

The basic behavior of a modal is to hide all content from all users that is "behind" the modal
dialog.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Without Close Icon

If you wish to remove the close icon button, you can simply omit the `Modal.CloseButton`
subcomponent. If you have a modal dialog that requires the user to accept instead of dismiss though
an escape key or clicking outside the modal, you must create a new `PopupModel` without those
behaviors and hand that model to the Modal dialog component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithoutCloseIcon} />

### Custom Focus

By default, the Modal makes sure the first focusable element receives focus when the Modal is
opened. Most of the time, this is the `Modal.CloseIcon` button. If that element isn't present, the
Modal will use the Modal Heading to make sure screen reader users have focus near the start of the
Modal's content. This allows screen reader users to discover the Modal's content more naturally
without having to navigate back up again. Sometimes, it is a better user experience to focus on a
different element. The following example shows how `initialFocusRef` can be used to change which
element receives focus when the modal opens.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomFocus} />

### Return Focus

By default, the Modal will return focus to the `Modal.Target` element, but it is possible the Modal
was triggered by an element that won't exist when the modal is closed. An example might be a Modal
that was opened from an Menu item and the act of opening the Modal also closes the Menu, meaning the
Menu item can no longer receive focus. The also probably means the `Modal.Target` component might
not suite your needs. The `Modal.Target` adds both a `ref` and an `onClick`. If you provide a
`returnFocusRef`, you only need to worry about the `onClick`. If you're using a menu, you might need
to use a different callback. Calling `model.events.show()` will show the Modal.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ReturnFocus} />

### Custom Target

It is common to have a custom target for your modal. Use the `as` prop to use your custom component.
The `Modal.Target` element will add `onClick` and `ref` to the provided component. Your provided
target component must forward the `onClick` to an element for the Modal to open. The `as` will cause
`Modal.Target` to inherit the interface of your custom target component. This means any props your
target requires, `Modal.Target` now also requires. The example below has a `MyTarget` component that
requires a `label` prop.

> **Note**: If your application needs to programmatically open a Modal without the user interacting
> with the target button first, you'll also need to use `React.forwardRef` in your target component.
> Without this, the Modal will open at the top-left of the window instead of around the target.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomTarget} />

### Body Content Overflow

The Modal automatically handles overflowing content inside the `Modal.Body` element. If contents are
larger than the browser's height will allow, the content will overflow with a scrollbar. You may
need to restrict the height of your browser to observe the overflow.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BodyOverflow} />

### Full overlay scrolling

If content is large, scrolling the entire overlay container is an option. Use the
`Modal.OverflowOverlay` component instead of the `Modal.Overlay` component. The `Modal.Card`'s
`maxHeight` and `height` will need to be reset to `inherit` to prevent any internal overflow.

This has the effect of scrolling the heading, close button, and any action buttons. If this type of
scrolling behavior is not desired, try the [Body Content Overflow](#body-content-overflow) method.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FullOverflow} />

### Form Modal

The `Modal.Card` can be turned into a `form` element to make a form modal. The `model` should be
hoisted to allow for form validation and allow you to control when the modal closes.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FormModal} />
