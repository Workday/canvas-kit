# Canvas Kit Dialog

A Dialog component is a non-Modal type of Dialog that will not render the rest of the page inert
while it is active. A Dialog should be used in situations where the task is not critical.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic

Below you will find a basic example of a Dialog. There are similarities and differences between the
[Modal](/components/popups/modal/) and Dialog components. A Dialog does not require immeditate
attention from the user and will not render the rest of the page inert while it is active. A
[Modal](/components/popups/modal/) Dialog requires immediate attention and blocks interaction from
the rest of the system.

A Dialog should be used in situations where the task is not critical like in the example below.

### Non-Focus Trapping

It was referenced in the first example that Dialog and [Modal](/components/popups/modal/) have some
similarities and differences. One difference is since Modal needs immediate attention from the user,
it will trap the keyboard focus inside of the Modal until an action is taken. Dialog does not need
immediate attention from the user so therefore, Dialog will not trap the keyboard focus within the
Dialog.
