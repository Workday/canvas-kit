# Canvas Kit Dialog

A Modal component that allows you to render a Popup with translucent overlays.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

This component follows the
[W3 Modal specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal#tabpanel). `Modal`
is a [Compound Component](../../../../modules/docs/mdx/COMPOUND_COMPONENTS.mdx), which means it can
be composed in a variety of different ways. We'll first cover some basic usage examples followed by
more advanced usage.

### Basic Usage

Below are examples we expect will work for most cases. Please refer to the
[Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) section for details on supporting custom implementations.

#### Basic Example

In this example, a few tab items and tab panels are set up without any named keys.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Simple} />

### Advanced Usage

Below are some examples for more advanced / custom use cases. We expect most people won't need to
read this section, but if you're needing to go beyond basic examples or are curious, feel free to
explore this section. While these examples are not exhaustive, they provide additional insight into
what's possible.

## Components

### Tabs

The `Tabs` component is the container component that is responsible for creating a `TabsModel` that
is shared using React context. It does not represent a real element.

#### Usage

```tsx
// configuration
<Tabs onActivate={({ data }) => console.log('Activate tab', data.tab)}>
  {/* sub components go here */ }
</Tabs>

// OR

// model
const model = useTabsModel(config)

<Tabs model={model}>
  {/* sub components go here */ }
</Tabs>
```
