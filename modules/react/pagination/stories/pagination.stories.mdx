# Canvas Kit Pagination

`Pagination` is a
[compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/) that allows
users to navigate between pages in a range.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/navigation/pagination)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`Pagination` includes a container `Pagination` component and a number of subcomponents which can be
composed in a variety of ways.

In this example, we set up a basic `Pagination` component with the default range of five pages, as
well as step controls (`Pagination.StepToPreviousButton` and `Pagination.StepToNextButton`) that
allow you to move to the previous page or the next page.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

Note that you must include `Pagination.AdditionalDetails` to meet accessibility standards (with one
exception, see [`Pagination.AdditionalDetails`](#paginationadditionaldetails) for more information).
It is an `aria-live` region that announces the current page update to screen readers. If you wish to
prevent it from displaying (as we've done in the remaining examples), you may set its
`shouldHideDetails` prop to `true`. The visually hidden region will still be accessible to screen
readers.

### Hoisted Model

By default, `Pagination` will create and use its own [model](#model) internally. Alternatively, you
may configure your own model with `usePaginationModel` and pass it to `Pagination` via the `model`
prop. This pattern is referred to as
[hoisting the model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#configuring-a-model)
and provides direct access to its `state` and `events` outside of the `Pagination` component.

In this example, we set up external observation of the model state and create an external button to
trigger an event to change the current page.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={HoistedModel} />

### Jump Controls

This example adds jump controls (`Pagination.JumpToFirstButton` and `Pagination.JumpToLastButton`)
that allow you to skip to the first and last pages in the range.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={JumpControls} />

### GoTo Form

This example adds a form (`Pagination.GoToForm`) that allows you to skip to a specific page within
the range.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={GoToForm} />

### Right-to-Left (RTL)

`Pagination` supports right-to-left languages when specified in the `CanvasProvider` `theme`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTL} />

### Custom Range

This example uses a custom range that allows you to control the width of the component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomRange} />

## Components

### Pagination

#### Usage

`Pagination` is a container component rendered as a `<nav>` element that is responsible for creating
a `PaginationModel` and sharing it with its subcomponents using React context.

```tsx
<Pagination
  aria-label="Pagination"
  lastPage={100}
  initialCurrentPage={6}
  rangeSize={3}
  onPageChange={pageNumber => console.log(pageNumber)}
>
  {/* Child components */}
</Pagination>
```

Alternatively, you may pass in a model using the hoisted model pattern.

```tsx
const model = usePaginationModel({
  lastPage: 100,
  initialCurrentPage: 6,
  rangeSize: 3,
  onPageChange: pageNumber => console.log(pageNumber),
});

return (
  <Pagination aria-label="Pagination" model={model}>
    {/* Child components */}
  </Pagination>
);
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<nav>` element.

<ArgsTable of={PaginationModelConfigComponent} />

If you're using the hoisted model pattern, follow this table instead (refer to the [Model](#model)
section for more information about `PaginationModel`):

<ArgsTable of={PaginationHoistedComponent} />

Note that you must set `aria-label` in either case to meet accessibility standards. We recommend
setting it to `Pagination` or the translated equivalent.

### Pagination.Controls

#### Usage

`Pagination.Controls` is a styled `<div>` element that provides proper alignment and spacing between
elements inside `Pagination`. It does not handle any internal business logic or state.

```tsx
<Pagination.Controls>{/* Child components */}</Pagination.Controls>
```

#### Props

`Pagination.Controls` does not have any documented props.

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<div>` element.

### Pagination.JumpToFirstButton

#### Usage

`Pagination.JumpToFirstButton` is an `IconButton` that subscribes to the `Pagination` context. This
allows it to know when to disable and set `currentPage` to the first page.

```tsx
<Pagination.JumpToFirstButton aria-label="First" />
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element. Note that you must set
`aria-label` to meet accessibility standards. We recommend setting it to `First` or the translated
equivalent.

`Pagination.JumpToFirstButton` supports all `IconButton` props.

### Pagination.StepToPreviousButton

#### Usage

`Pagination.StepToPreviousButton` is an `IconButton` that subscribes to the `Pagination` context.
This allows it to know when to disable and decrement the `currentPage`.

```tsx
<Pagination.StepToPreviousButton aria-label="Previous" />
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element. Note that you must set
`aria-label` to meet accessibility standards. We recommend setting it to `Previous` or the
translated equivalent.

`Pagination.StepToPreviousButton` supports all `IconButton` props.

### Pagination.StepToNextButton

#### Usage

`Pagination.StepToNextButton` is an `IconButton` that subscribes to the `Pagination` context. This
allows it to know when to disable and increment the `currentPage`.

```tsx
<Pagination.StepToNextButton aria-label="Next" />
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element. Note that you must set
`aria-label` to meet accessibility standards. We recommend setting it to `Next` or the translated
equivalent.

`Pagination.StepToNextButton` supports all `IconButton` props.

### Pagination.JumpToLastButton

#### Usage

`Pagination.JumpToLastButton` is an `IconButton` that subscribes to the `Pagination` context. This
allows it to know when to disable and set `currentPage` to the last page.

```tsx
<Pagination.JumpToLastButton aria-label="Last" />
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element. Note that you must set
`aria-label` to meet accessibility standards. We recommend setting it to `Last` or the translated
equivalent.

`Pagination.JumpToLastButton` supports all `IconButton` props.

### Pagination.PageList

#### Usage

`Pagination.PageList` is an `<ol>` element that subscribes to the `Pagination` context. This allows
it generate the `range` of page numbers. It also handles spacing between the child elements.

This component will accept either child elements or a render prop. In most cases, you'll want to use
the render prop so you can access the `Pagination` model in order to generate the proper list items.

```tsx
<Pagination.PageList>
  {({state}) =>
    state.range.map(pageNumber => (
      <Pagination.PageListItem key={pageNumber}>
        <Pagination.PageButton aria-label={`Page ${pageNumber}`} pageNumber={pageNumber} />
      </Pagination.PageListItem>
    ))
  }
</Pagination.PageList>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<ol>` element.

<ArgsTable of={PageListComponent} />

### Pagination.PageListItem

#### Usage

`Pagination.PageListItem` is a styled `<li>` element. It provides a semantic child element for the
`PageList` component and is important for accessibility. It does not handle any internal business
logic or state.

```tsx
<Pagination.PageListItem>{/* Child element */}</Pagination.PageListItem>
```

#### Props

`Pagination.PageListItem` does not have any documented props.

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<li>` element.

### Pagination.PageButton

#### Usage

`Pagination.PageButton` is an `IconButton` that subscribes to the `Pagination` context. This allows
it to update the `currentPage` and set the `toggled` styling when it is the current item.

`Pagination.PageButton` will render `pageNumber` as its children.

```tsx
<Pagination.PageButton aria-label="Page 2" pageNumber={2} />
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element. Note that you must set
`aria-label` to meet accessibility standards. We recommend setting it to `Page ${pageNumber}` or the
translated equivalent.

<ArgsTable of={PageButtonComponent} />

`Pagination.PageButton` also supports all `IconButton` props.

### Pagination.GoToForm

#### Usage

`Pagination.GoToForm` is a wrapper for a React context provider rendered as a `<form>` element.
Child components such as `Pagination.GoToTextInput` and `Pagination.GoToLabel` subscribe to that
context to manage the form state and behavior as well as update the `currentPage` in the
`Pagination` component.

```tsx
<Pagination.GoToForm>{/* Child elements */}</Pagination.GoToForm>
```

#### Props

`Pagination.GoToForm` does not have any documented props.

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<form>` element.

### Pagination.GoToTextInput

#### Usage

`Pagination.GoToTextInput` is a `TextInput`.

```tsx
<Pagination.GoToTextInput aria-label="Go to page number" />
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<input type="text">` element. Note that you must
set `aria-label` to meet accessibility standards. We recommend setting it to `Go to page number` or
the translated equivalent.

`Pagination.GoToTextInput` supports all `TextInput` props.

### Pagination.GoToLabel

#### Usage

`Pagination.GoToLabel` is a styled `<label>` element that subscribes to the `Pagination` context.
This allows it to pass the `Pagination` context to child elements.

This component will accept either child elements or a render prop. In most cases, you'll want to use
the render prop so you can access the `Pagination` model when generating the label text.

```tsx
<Pagination.GoToLabel>{({state}) => `of ${state.lastPage} pages`}</Pagination.GoToLabel>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<label>` element.

<ArgsTable of={Pagination.GoToLabel} />

### Pagination.AdditionalDetails

#### Usage

`Pagination.AdditionalDetails` is a styled `<div>` element that subscribes to the `Pagination`
context. This allows it to pass the `Pagination` context to child elements. It is also an
`aria-live` region that announces the current page update to screen readers.

`Pagination.AdditionalDetails` must be included in your `Pagination` component to meet accessibility
standards (with one exception, see below). If you wish to prevent it from displaying, you may set
its `shouldHideDetails` prop to `true`. The visually hidden region will still be accessible to
screen readers.

If you have multiple `Pagination` components sharing the same state and rendered on the same page,
you may do either of the following to prevent screen readers from announcing the same update
multiple times:

- Exclude `Pagination.AdditionalDetails` from all but one of the `Pagination` components. This is
  the one case where you may exclude `Pagination.AdditionalDetails` from a `Pagination` component.
- Include `Pagination.AdditionalDetails` in every `Pagination` component (i.e., you want it to be
  visible for every component), but set the `shouldAnnounceToScreenReader` prop to `false` on all
  but one of them.

This component will accept either child elements or a render prop. In most cases, you'll want to use
the render prop so you can access the `Pagination` model in order to generate the appropriate text.

```tsx
<Pagination.AdditionalDetails>
  {({state}) =>
    `${getVisibleResultsMin(state.currentPage, resultCount)}-${getVisibleResultsMax(
      state.currentPage,
      resultCount,
      totalCount
    )} of ${totalCount} results`
  }
</Pagination.AdditionalDetails>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<div>` element.

<ArgsTable of={AdditionalDetailsComponent} />

## Model

If `Pagination` was stripped of all its markup, attributes, and styling, what would remain is the
[model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#models). The model is an
object composed of two parts: `state` which describes the current snapshot in time of the component
and `events` which describes events that can be sent to the model.

By default, `Pagination` will create a model and share it internally with its subcomponents using
React context. You may subscribe to `PaginationContext` if you wish to create a custom subcomponent
for your implementation. Here's a simple example.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {Pagination, PaginationContext} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/pagination';

const CustomButton = (props: React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
  const model = React.useContext(PaginationContext);

  const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>) => {
    // If onClick is provided, pass the event along
    props.onClick?.(e);
    model.events.goTo(10);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick} {...props}>
      Go To Page 10
    </button>
  );
};

export const CustomPagination = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination aria-label="Pagination" lastPage={20}>
      <CustomButton aria-label="Page 10" />
      {/* Other subcomponents */}
    </Pagination>
  );
};
```

Alternatively, if you need direct access to the model's `state` and `events` outside of the
`Pagination` component, you may configure your own model with `usePaginationModel` and pass it to
`Pagination` via a pattern called
[hoisting the model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#configuring-a-model).

```tsx
const model = usePaginationModel({
  lastPage,
  onPageChange: number => console.log(number),
});

<Pagination aria-label="Pagination" model={model}>
  {/* Child components */}
</Pagination>;
```

### Config

`usePaginationModel` accepts a configuration object with the following properties and returns a
`PaginationModel` with `state` and `events` properties.

<ArgsTable of={PaginationModelConfigComponent} />

### State

The `PaginationModel` `state` is an object with the following properties.

<ArgsTable of={PaginationStateComponent} />

### Events

The `PaginationModel` `events` is an object with the following properties.

<ArgsTable of={PaginationEventsComponent} />

## Utilities

### getLastPage

This function takes the number of results per page and the total count of results and returns the
last page number. Here's an example:

Given there are 10 results per page, and there are 128 total results, the function will return 13.

```ts
const resultCount = 10;
const totalCount = 128;
const lastPage = getLastPage(resultCount, totalCount); //=> 13
```

### getRangeMin

This function takes the pagination range and returns its minimum value. Here's an example:

Given the pagination range is 1-5, the function will return 1.

```ts
const range = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const rangeMin = getRangeMin(range); //=> 1
```

### getRangeMax

This function takes the pagination range and returns its maximum value. Here's an example:

Given the pagination range is 1-5, the function will return 5.

```ts
const range = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const rangeMin = getRangeMax(range); //=> 5
```

### getVisibleResultsMin

This function takes the current page, and number of results per page, and returns the minimum value
for that page. Here's an example:

Given there are 10 results per page, and the current page is 5, the function will return 41.

```ts
const currentPage = 5;
const resultCount = 10;
const pageMin = getVisibleResultsMin(currentPage, resultCount); //=> 41
```

### getVisibleResultsMax

This function takes the current page, number of results per page, and the total number of results,
and returns the maximum value for that page. Here's an example:

Given there are 10 results per page, the current page is 5, and there are 42 results total, the
function will return 42.

```ts
const currentPage = 5;
const resultCount = 10;
const totalCount = 42;
const pageMax = getVisibleResultsMax(currentPage, resultCount, totalCount); //=> 42
```
