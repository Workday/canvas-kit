# Canvas Kit Button

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/buttons/buttons)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### PrimaryButton

Here is a basic example of a Primary Button. Buttons can be customized with several props to change
the size, add an icon, etc.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Primary} />

#### Accessible Use of the `as` Prop

Like many of our components, Buttons accept an `as` prop, which lets you change the underlying
semantic element - usually an `a` (anchor), or a `button`. This should be done with caution to
ensure the best accessibility. Generally, `button` elements should be used for actions, and `a`
(anchor) elements should be used for navigation.

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `button` element.

<ArgsTable of={PrimaryButton} />
