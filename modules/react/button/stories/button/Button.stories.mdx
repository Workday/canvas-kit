## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### PrimaryButton

Here is a basic example of a Primary Button. Buttons can be customized with several props to change
the size, add an icon, etc.

Primary Buttons are high emphasis. Use once per screen to draw attention to the highest priority
action. Multiple primary buttons make it confusing for the user to understand what action they
should take. Not all screens require a Primary Button.

Primary Buttons have four sizes: `extraSmall`, `small`, `medium`, and `large`. Icons are supported
for every size and can be positioned to the `left` or `right` with the `iconPosition` prop.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Primary} />

Primary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. While it looks similar to the default Secondary
Button, the default outline as well as the hover and focus states are different. Use this variant
when you need to place a Primary Button on a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={PrimaryInverse} />

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element.

### SecondaryButton

Secondary Buttons have a medium level of emphasis. Use them for non-critical actions. Secondary
Buttons can be used on most pages without restrictions and work well for multiple actions of equal
weight. They can be used in conjunction with a Primary Button or independently.

Secondary Buttons have four sizes: `extraSmall`, `small`, `medium`, and `large`. Icons are supported
for every size and can be positioned to the `left` or `right` with the `iconPosition` prop.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Secondary} />

Secondary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. Use this when you need to place a Secondary Button on
a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={SecondaryInverse} />

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element.

<ArgsTable of={SecondaryButton} />

### TertiaryButton

Tertiary Buttons have the lowest emphasis (before Icon Buttons). Use for less important actions that
the user may not often be looking to do. Tertiary Buttons have lower prominence as its container is
not visible until it is interacted with. Use Tertiary Buttons for supplemental actions such as “View
More”, “Read More” or “Select a File”. Tertiary Buttons are frequently used on Cards.

Tertiary Buttons have three sizes: `extraSmall`, `small`, and `medium`. Icons are supported
for every size and can be positioned to the `left` or `right` with the `iconPosition` prop.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Tertiary} />

Tertiary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. Use this when you need to place a Tertiary Button on
a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={TertiaryInverse} />


#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element.

### DeleteButton

Use sparingly for destructive actions that will result in data loss, can’t be undone, or will have
significant consequences. They commonly appear in confirmation dialogs as the final confirmation
before deleting.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Delete} />

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<button>` element.

<ArgsTable of={DeleteButton} />

### Accessible Use of the `as` Prop

Like many of our components, Buttons accept an `as` prop, which lets you change the underlying
semantic element - usually an `<a>`, or a `<button>`. This should be done with caution to ensure the
best accessibility. Generally, `<button>` elements should be used for actions, and `<a>` elements
should be used for navigation.
