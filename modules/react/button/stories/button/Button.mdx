# Canvas Kit Button

Clickable button elements that extend the native `<button>` element with Canvas styling.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/buttons/buttons)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### PrimaryButton

<SymbolDescription name="PrimaryButton" fileName="/react/" />

The example below shows multiple instances of a `PrimaryButton` with various icon configurations.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Primary} />

Primary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. While it looks similar to the default Secondary
Button, the default outline as well as the hover and focus states are different. Use this variant
when you need to place a Primary Button on a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={PrimaryInverse} />

### SecondaryButton

<SymbolDescription name="SecondaryButton" fileName="/react/" />

The example below shows multiple instances of a `SecondaryButton` with various icon configurations.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Secondary} />

Secondary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. Use this when you need to place a Secondary Button
on a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={SecondaryInverse} />

### TertiaryButton

<SymbolDescription name="TertiaryButton" fileName="/react/" />

The example below shows multiple instances of a `TertiaryButton` with various icon configurations.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Tertiary} />

Tertiary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. Use this when you need to place a Tertiary Button
on a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={TertiaryInverse} />

### DeleteButton

<SymbolDescription name="DeleteButton" fileName="/react/" />

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Delete} />

### Grow Prop

The example below shows the use of the `grow` prop on different variants of buttons. This will set
the width of the button to the width of its container.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Grow} />

### Custom Styles

All of our buttons support custom styling via the `cs` prop. For more information, check our
["How To Customize Styles"](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-how-to-customize-styles--docs)
or view the example below.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomStyles} />

### Theme Overrides

The most common way to theme our buttons is to pass a `theme` object at the root level of the application via the `CanvasProvider`. In the example below, our buttons use our `brand.action.**` tokens with the fallback being `brand.primary.**`. 

> **Caution:** Setting `--cnvs-brand-action**` tokens at the `:root` CSS will override all `PrimaryButton` theme colors set at the `CanvasProvider` level.

> **Note:** You should **not** individually theme components wrapping them with the `CanvasProvider`, but rather theme at the root level of the application.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ThemeOverrides} />

### Accessible Use of the `as` Prop

Like many of our components, Buttons accept an `as` prop, which lets you change the underlying
semantic element - usually an `<a>`, or a `<button>`. This should be done with caution to ensure the
best accessibility. Generally, `<button>` elements should be used for actions, and `<a>` elements
should be used for navigation.
