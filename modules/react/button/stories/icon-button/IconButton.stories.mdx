# Canvas Kit Icon Button

Clickable icon button elements that extend the native `<button>` element with Canvas styling.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/buttons/icon-buttons)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of an Icon Button. Buttons can be customized with several props to change
the size, variant, etc.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Circle} />

### Variants

`circle` is the default variant. Circle Icon Buttons have a hover state and should be used for
actions that require more emphasis than Plain Buttons.

Below are the other available variants:

#### CircleFilled

Filled Icon Buttons have a gray background and a hover state. Use these buttons for high-emphasis
actions.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CircleFilled} />

#### Plain

Plain Icon Buttons don’t have a hover state and should be used for low-emphasis actions.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Plain} />

#### Square

Square Icon Buttons are the equivalent to Default Icon Buttons and are typically used in Toolbars.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Square} />

#### SquareFilled

Square Filled Icon Buttons are the equivalent to Filled Icon Buttons and are used in Icon Button
Toggle Groups.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={SquareFilled} />

#### Inverse

Inverse Icon Buttons should be used on dark backgrounds.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Inverse} />

#### InverseFilled

InverseFilled Icon Buttons are a higher emphasis version of Inverse, and should be used on dark
backgrounds.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={InverseFilled} />

### Mirroring Icons

Sometimes icons should be mirrored for bidirectional support. Setting the `shouldMirrorIcon` prop to
`true` will transform the icon's x-axis to mirror the graphic. This is often useful when there is no
equivalent mirrored icon available. Below is an example of the `unorderedListIcon` being rendered in
its default state with an icon showing a left-to-right bulleted list. Beside it is the same icon
that has been mirrored to show a right-to-left bulleted list.

Note that while the `aria-label` text in this example did not need to be updated, if the label
contains directional descriptors such as "right" and "left," the text should also be updated.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={MirroredIcon} />

### Toggleability

The `toggle` prop can be used to make icon buttons toggleable.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Toggleable} />

## Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `button` element.
