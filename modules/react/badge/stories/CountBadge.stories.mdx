# Canvas Kit Count Badge

`CountBadge` provides a quantity-based summary with dynamic values.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

The following section provides examples for common use cases. Please be sure to also read the
Accessibility section below.

### Basic

In the example below, we're rendering a basic `CountBadge` with its `default` and `inverse`
variants. The `inverse` variant is intended for darker backgrounds to create more contrast.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Custom Limit

By default, `CountBadge`'s limit is set to `1000`. Once the count reaches the limit, the badge will
format the number: `1000` becomes `999+`. The default limit is largely arbitrary and intended to
prevent unexpected overflow. You should choose a limit based on your specific use case and consider
the user's experience. For example, someone looking for a new job finds there are `99+` new
opportunities. Or perhaps someone returns from extended leave and is overwhelmed by `999+` unread
messages on their first day back.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomLimit} />

### Notification Badge

Notifications are a major use case for `CountBadge`. Remember that any `CountBadge` with a
live-updating value should be announced to screen readers with an `aria-live` region and an
`aria-label` on the button to provide additional context, as in the example below. Please also read
the Accessibility guidance below this example for aditional information.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={NotificationBadge} />

## Accessibility

A common use case for `CountBadge` is displaying notifications, but there are other situations where
they will have live-updated values. There are several accessibility concerns you'll want to keep in
mind:

- The button should have an aria-label that updates with the count
- The elements inside the button should have `aria-hidden`
- The live region should be outside the button
- The live region should be visually hidden and only contain text
