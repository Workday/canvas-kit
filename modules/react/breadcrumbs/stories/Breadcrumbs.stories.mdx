# Canvas Kit Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is a [compound component](/docs/guides-compound-components--page) that allows users to
keep track and maintain awareness of their location as they navigate through pages, folders, files,
etc.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/navigation/breadcrumbs)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`Breadcrumbs` includes a container `Breadcrumbs` component and the following subcomponents which can
be composed in a variety of ways: `Breadcrumbs.List`, `Breadcrumbs.Item`, `Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem`
and `Breadcrumbs.Link`.

Accessibility is built into `Breadcrumbs` in a way that allows you to create an inclusive experience
with little additional configuration. As seen in the example below, you don't need to pass any
accessibility attributes, because they are baked into the component. You only need to add
`aria-label` attribute to a `nav` component through a `aria-label` prop of `Breadcrumbs`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

Note that all links require an `href` to be properly identified.

### Overflow Breadcrumbs

`Breadcrumbs` is a responsive component based on the width of its container. If the rendered links
exceed the width of the `Breadcrumbs.List`, an overflow menu will be rendered. This only works
against the dynamic API where you give the `BreadcrumbsModel` an array of items to be rendered. The
dynamic API handles the React `key` for you based on the item's identifier. The dynamic API requires
either an `id` on each item object or a `getId` function that returns an identifier based on the
item. The example below uses an `id` property on each item.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={OverflowBreadcrumbs} />

The dynamic API takes in any object, but since nothing is known about your object, a
[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) is necessary to instruct a list how it
should render.

### Right-to-Left (RTL)

`Breadcrumbs` has bidirectional support out of the box. That means outside of setting the content
direction in your application's Canvas theme, you don't need to do anything else to make it work.
All you need to supply is the translated text for items and ARIA labels.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTLOverflowList} />

## Components

### Breadcrumbs

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs` is a container component that is responsible for creating a `BreadcrumbsModel` and
sharing it with its subcomponents using React context. It also renders `nav` element, and
`aria-label` attribute must be provided for this element.

```tsx
<Breadcrumbs items={[]} aria-label="Breadcrumbs">
  {/* Child components */}
</Breadcrumbs>
```

Alternatively, you may pass in a model using the hoisted model pattern.

```tsx
const model = useBreadcrumbsModel({
  items: [],
});

<Breadcrumbs model={model} aria-label="Breadcrumbs">
  {/* Child components */}
</Breadcrumbs>;
```

#### Props

Note that if you pass in a `model` configured with `useBreadcrumbsModel`, configuration props passed
to `Breadcrumbs` will be ignored. `aria-label` attribute must be provided for `nav` element.

All undeclared props go to underlying `nav` component.

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs} />

### Breadcrumbs.List

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.List` is a `Flex` component rendered as a `<ul>` element. It is a container for
`Breadcrumbs.Item` subcomponents. It also renders overflow button if `overflowButton` prop has been
passed;

```tsx
// without overflow
<Breadcrumbs.List>{/* Breadcrumbs.Items */}</Breadcrumbs.List>
```

```tsx
// with overflow
<Breadcrumbs.List overflowButton={<Breadcrumbs.OverflowButton aria-label="More links" />}>
  {/* Breadcrumbs.Items */}
</Breadcrumbs.List>
```

#### Props

`Breadcrumbs.List` accepts a `overflowButton` prop allowing to pass specific overflow button.
Breadcrumbs.List with overflow behavior should contain `overflowButton` component with `aria-label`
to render overflow button.

All undocumented props are spread to the underlying `Flex` component.

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.List} />

### Breadcrumbs.Item

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.Item` is a `Flex` component rendered as an `<li>` element. It is a container for the
`Breadcrumbs.Link` subcomponent which provides correct overflow behavior across all items.

```tsx
<Breadcrumbs.Item data-id="first">First Tab</Breadcrumbs.Item>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `Flex` component.

### Breadcrumbs.Link

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.Link` is a styled `<a>` element that also renders a tooltip if the text is truncated.
The built-in truncation and tooltip functionality provides an easy-to-use, accessible feature for
managing the length of link text. The `maxWidth` is set to `350px` by default and can be adjusted as
needed. Note that tooltips will only render when text is truncated. The example below uses a
`maxWidth` of `150px`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={LinkTruncation} />

##### Handling Redirects

`Breadcrumbs.Link` defaults to redirecting with an `href`, which means the page will hard-redirect
when the link is clicked. However, if you're in a single-page application (SPA) environment, you
might want to use the internal SPA router instead. You can override that behavior with a custom
`onClick` handler that blocks the default behavior of the event and passes along the link path to
your SPA router. Most of our consumers use `react-router-dom` for managing SPA routing, so below is
an example of how to do this in V5 and V6 of `react-router-dom`.

```ts
// React Router DOM V5 API
import {useHistory} from 'react-router-dom';
import {Breadcrumbs} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/breadcrumbs';
...
const history = useHistory();
const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement, MouseEvent>, link?: string) => {
      event.preventDefault();
    // if no link is provided, default to the current path
    history.push(link || window.location.pathname);
}
return (
  <Breadcrumbs.Link href="/account" onClick={handleClick}>
    Account
  </Breadcrumbs.Link>
);

// React Router DOM V6 API
import {useNavigate} from 'react-router-dom';
import {Breadcrumbs} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/breadcrumbs';
...
const navigate = useNavigate();
const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement, MouseEvent>, link?: string) => {
      event.preventDefault();
    // if no link is provided, default to the current path
    navigate(link || window.location.pathname);
}
return (
  <Breadcrumbs.Link href="/account" onClick={handleClick}>
    Account
  </Breadcrumbs.Link>
);
```

#### Props

This component also supports
[all native `<a>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#Attributes).

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.Link} />

### Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem` is a styled `<li>` element that also renders a tooltip if the text is
truncated. The built-in truncation and tooltip functionality provides an easy-to-use, accessible
feature for managing the length of the text. The `maxWidth` is set to `350px` by default and can be
adjusted as needed. Normally, this is a non-focusable element; when truncated, however, it sets the
`tabIndex` to `0` to enable the tooltip to appear on keyboard focus. Note that tooltips will only
render when text is truncated. The example below uses a `maxWidth` of `100px`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CurrentItemTruncation} />

#### Props

This component also supports
[all native `<li>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#Attributes).

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem} />

### Breadcrumbs.Menu

The `Breadcrumbs.Menu` uses the `Menu` component under the hood. Please view our
[Menu docs](https://canvas.workdaydesign.com/components/popups/menu#component-api) for more in-depth
component information.

## Model

If `Breadcrumbs` was stripped of all its markup, attributes, and styling, what would remain is the
[model](/docs/guides-compound-components--page#models). The model is an object composed of two
parts: `state` which describes the current snapshot in time of the component and `events` which
describes events that can be sent to the model.

By default, `Breadcrumbs` will create a model and share it internally with its subcomponents using
React context. Alternatively, if you need direct access to the model's `state` and `events` outside
of the `Breadcrumbs` component, you may configure your own model with `useBreadcrumbsModel` and pass
it to `Breadcrumbs` via a pattern called
[hoisting the model](/docs/guides-compound-components--page#configuring-a-model).

```tsx
const model = useBreadcrumbsModel({
  items: [],
});

<Breadcrumbs model={model}>{/* Child components */}</Breadcrumbs>;
```

### Config

`useBreadcrumbsModel` accepts a configuration object with the following properties and returns a
`BreadcrumbsModel` with `state` and `events` properties.

<ArgsTable of={BreadcrumbsModelConfigComponent} />

### State

The `BreadcrumbsModel` `state` is an object with the following properties.

<ArgsTable of={BreadcrumbsStateComponent} />

### Events

The `BreadcrumbsModel` `events` is an object with the following properties.

<ArgsTable of={BreadcrumbsEventsComponent} />
