# Canvas Kit Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is a
[compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/) that allows
users to keep track and maintain awareness of their location as they navigate through pages,
folders, files, etc.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://canvas.workday.com/components/navigation/breadcrumbs)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`Breadcrumbs` includes a container `Breadcrumbs` component and the following subcomponents which can
be composed in a variety of ways: `Breadcrumbs.List`, `Breadcrumbs.Item`, `Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem`
and `Breadcrumbs.Link`.

Accessibility is built into `Breadcrumbs` in a way that allows you to create an inclusive experience
with little additional configuration. As seen in the example below, the only ARIA attribute you'll
need to add is an `aria-label` to the `Breadcrumbs.List`. All other accessibility attributes are
baked into the component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

Note that all links require an `href` to be properly identified.

### Collapsed List

`Breadcrumbs` is a responsive component based on the width of its container. If the rendered links
exceed the width of the `Breadcrumbs.List`, an overflow menu will be rendered. This only works
against the dynamic API where you give the `BreadcrumbsModel` an array of items to be rendered. The
dynamic API handles the React `key` for you based on the item's identifier. The dynamic API requires
either an `id` on each item object or a `getId` function that returns an identifier based on the
item. The example below uses an `id` property on each item.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Collapsed} />

The dynamic API takes in any object, but since nothing is known about your object, a
[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) is necessary to instruct a list how it
should render.

### Right-to-Left (RTL)

`Breadcrumbs` has bidirectional support out of the box. That means outside of setting the content
direction in your application's Canvas theme, you don't need to do anything else to make it work.
All you need to supply is the translated text for items and ARIA labels.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTLCollapsibleList} />

## Components

### Breadcrumbs

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs` is a container component that is responsible for creating a `BreadcrumbsModel` and
sharing it with its subcomponents using React context. It does not represent a real element.

```tsx
<Breadcrumbs items={[]}>{/* Child components */}</Breadcrumbs>
```

Alternatively, you may pass in a model using the hoisted model pattern.

```tsx
const model = useBreadcrumbsModel({
  items: [],
});

<Breadcrumbs model={model}>{/* Child components */}</Breadcrumbs>;
```

#### Props

Note that if you pass in a `model` configured with `useBreadcrumbsModel`, configuration props passed
to `Breadcrumbs` will be ignored.

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs} />

### Breadcrumbs.List

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.List` is a `Flex` component rendered as a `<ul>` element and wrapped within a `<nav>`
element. It is a container for `Breadcrumbs.Item` subcomponents.

```tsx
<Breadcrumbs.List>{/* Breadcrumbs.Items */}</Breadcrumbs.List>
```

#### Props

`Breadcrumbs.List` accepts an `aria-label` prop for its `<nav>` element and a `buttonAriaLabel` prop
which is applied as an `aria-label` to the overflow button.

All undocumented props are spread to the underlying `Flex` component.

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.List} />

---

### Breadcrumbs.Item

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.Item` is a `Flex` component as `li` element. It is container for `Breadcrumbs.Link`
component and provides correct overflow behavior across all items.

```tsx
<Breadcrumbs.Item data-id="first">First Tab</Breadcrumbs.Item>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `Flex` component.

---

### Breadcrumbs.Link

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.Link` is a styled `<a>` element that also renders a tooltip if the text is truncated.
The built-in truncation + tooltip functionality provides an easy-to-use, accessible feature for
managing the length of link text. The `maxWidth` is set to `350px` by default and can be adjusted as
needed. Note that tooltips will only render when text is truncated. Here's an example with the
`maxWidth` set to `150px`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={LinkTruncation} />

##### Handling Redirects

`Breadcrumbs.Link` defaults to redirecting with an `href`, meaning the page will hard-redirect when
the link is clicked. However, if you're in a single-page application (SPA) environment, you might
want to use the internal SPA router instead. You can override this hard-redirect with the `onAction`
prop. Note that `onAction` will not block any `onClick` if provided. Below is an example using the
`history` package.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
// using the history package
import {createBrowserHistory} from 'history';
import {Breadcrumbs} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/breadcrumbs';

// this is likely being done at the root of your application and not inside this component.
const history = createBrowserHistory();

const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement, MouseEvent>) => {
  // handle any click side-effects here
  console.log('click event', event);
}

const handleRedirect = (href: string) => {
  // redirect using the internal SPA router
  history.push(href);
}

return (
  <Breadcrumbs.Link
    href="/account"
    onAction={handleRedirect}
    onClick={handleClick}
  >
    Account
  </Breadcrumbs.Link>;
)
```

#### Props

This component also supports
[all native `<a>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#Attributes).

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.Link} />

---

### Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem` is a styled `<li>` element also renders a tooltip if the text is
truncated. The built-in truncation + tooltip functionality provides an easy-to-use, accessible
feature for managing the length of link text. The `maxWidth` is set to `350px` by default and can be
adjusted as needed. Normally, this is a non-focusable element. But when truncated, it sets the
`tabIndex` to `0` to enable the tooltip to appear on keyboard focus. Note that tooltips will only
render when text is truncated. Here's an example with the `maxWidth` set to `100px`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CurrentItemTruncation} />

#### Props

This component also supports
[all native `<li>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#Attributes).

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem} />

## Model

If `Breadcrumbs` was stripped of all its markup, attributes, and styling, what would remain is the
[model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#models). The model is an
object composed of two parts: `state` which describes the current snapshot in time of the component
and `events` which describes events that can be sent to the model.

By default, `Breadcrumbs` will create a model and share it internally with its subcomponents using
React context. Alternatively, if you need direct access to the model's `state` and `events` outside
of the `Breadcrumbs` component, you may configure your own model with `useBreadcrumbsModel` and pass
it to `Breadcrumbs` via a pattern called
[hoisting the model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#configuring-a-model).

```tsx
const model = useBreadcrumbsModel({
  items: [],
});

<Breadcrumbs model={model}>{/* Child components */}</Breadcrumbs>;
```

### Config

`useBreadcrumbsModel` accepts a configuration object with the following properties and returns a
`BreadcrumbsModel` with `state` and `events` properties.

<ArgsTable of={BreadcrumbsModelConfigComponent} />

### State

The `BreadcrumbsModel` `state` is an object with the following properties.

<ArgsTable of={BreadcrumbsStateComponent} />

### Events

The `BreadcrumbsModel` `events` is an object with the following properties.

<ArgsTable of={BreadcrumbsEventsComponent} />
