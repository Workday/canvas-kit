# Canvas Kit Menu

`Menu` displays a list of options when triggered by an action or UI element like an icon or button.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/popups/menus)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`Menu` is typically triggered by an action such as pressing a button. The `Menu` comes with a
`Target` subcomponent and a Popup.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

`Menu` will automatically focus on the cursor item (first item by default). The `Menu` uses a menu
model which composes a list model and a popup model and sets up accessibility features for you.

`Menu` follows the
[Actions Menu pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menu-button/menu-button-actions.html)
using roving tabindex. Below is table of supported keyboard shortcuts and associated actions.

| Key                | Action                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Enter` or `Space` | Activates the menu item and then closes the menu                                                             |
| `Escape`           | Closes the menu                                                                                              |
| `Up Arrow`         | Moves focus to the previous menu item – if focus is on first menu item, it moves focus to the last menu item |
| `Down Arrow`       | Moves focus to the next menu item – if focus is on last menu item, it moves focus to the first menu item     |
| `Home`             | Moves focus to the first menu item                                                                           |
| `End`              | Moves focus to the last menu item                                                                            |

## Components

### Menu

### Usage

`Menu` is a combination of as popup and a list. It usually has some type of target element that
expands/collapses the menu and a `menu` role and and several `menuitem` roles. Focus is managed uses
[roving tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex) for maximum
compatibility. A `Menu` can have two modes: `single` and `multiple`. This mode determines both how
many items can be selected as well as the default behavior when a menuitem is clicked. For the
`single` mode, selecting a `menuitem` will select and close the menu. For the `multiple` mode,
clicking a `menuitem` will toggle selection and will not close the menu.

#### Props

<ArgsTable of={Menu} />

#### Usage

Like all compound components, the `Menu` component is a container component. It is responsible for
putting a `MenuModel` in the React context for all the menu subcomponents. You can either pass this
component model config or a "hoisted" model.

With model config:

```tsx
<Menu mode="multiple">{/* Child components */}</Menu>
```

With a hoisted model:

```tsx
const model = useMenuModel({
  mode: 'multiple',
});

// we now have access to `model.state` and `model.events`

<Menu model={model}>{/* Child components */}</Menu>;
```

### Menu.Target

#### Usage

`Menu.Target` is similar to all `Popup.Target` types. The component only provides behavior and no
styling. The `as` prop is used to determine which component is rendered. This component should
forward the `ref` and apply any additional props directly to an element. The default `as` is a
`SecondaryButton`. Any Canvas Kit component should work with an `as`.

An example changing to a `PrimaryButton`

```tsx
<Menu.Target as={PrimaryButton}>Primary Button Text</Menu.Target>
```

This element will apply `aria-haspopup` and `aria-expanded` to inform screen readers there's a popup
associated with the element.

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the element provided by the `as` which is a `SecondaryButton` by
default.
