# Canvas Kit React Text

`Text` is a group of text components that provide a common, ergonomic API to render text with
simplified usage of Canvas Kit type token.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Text

### Usage

`Text` is the base component that is used to render text in the UI. It is built off of our `Box`
component which allows the use of styles props such as `display`, `margin`, `padding` as well as the
most common type styles such as `fontWeight`, `fontSize` amongst others. This component is an
extension of our [type tokens](https://canvas.workdaydesign.com/tokens/type/#type-styles),
therefore, props like `typeLevel` and `variant` all exists.

By default `Text` component is a `span` element, but it's possible to override the element by
passing `as` prop.

```tsx
<Text as="p" fontSize={14} fontWeight="medium">
  Text here...
</Text>
```

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BasicText} />

### Text Props

As previously mentioned, `Text` is built on top of `Box` and has access to all its props. In
addition `Text` has its own props:

<ArgsTable of={TextComponent} />

## Type Level Components

Type Level Components, `Subtext`, `BodyText`, `Heading` and `Title`, apply type token styles to text
element. Instead of passing type level token you can use one of Type Level Components, like in
example below:

```tsx
// v7
<p css={{...type.levels.subtext.small}}>Small Subtext Text</p>

// v8
<Subtext size="small">Small Subtext Text</Subtext>
```

### Props

In addition to `Text` component props, each type level components has the following props:

<ArgsTable of={TypeLevelComponent} />

### Title

`Title` component renders text with `type.levels.title[size]` styles.

```tsx
<Title size="small">Small Title Text</Title>
```

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Title} />
