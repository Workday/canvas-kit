# Canvas Kit React Text

`Text` is a group of text components that provide a common, ergonomic API to render text with
simplified usage of Canvas Kit type token.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Text

### Usage

`Text` is the base component that is used to render text in the UI. It is built off of our `Box`
component which allows the use of styles props such as `display`, `margin`, `padding` as well as the
most common type styles such as `fontWeight`, `fontSize` amongst others. This component is an
extension of our [type tokens](https://canvas.workdaydesign.com/tokens/type/#type-styles),
therefore, props like `typeLevel` and `variant` all exists.

By default `Text` component is a `span` element, but it's possible to override the element by
passing `as` prop.

```tsx
<Text as="p" fontSize={14} fontWeight="medium">
  Text here...
</Text>
```

### Text Props

As previously mentioned, `Text` is built on top of `Box` and has access to all its props. In
addition `Text` has its own props:

<ArgsTable of={TextComponent} />
