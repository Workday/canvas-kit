# Canvas Kit Segmented Control

A linear set of two or more segments, each of which functions as a mutually exclusive button. This
is a [_controlled_](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) component.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here is a basic example of a Segmented Control with multiple nested `Button`s. **Note:** while
managing state using a unique `value` for each `Button` child is encouraged, you can also use
indexes and omit the `value` field. It is strongly recommended to not mix these two methods.
