# Canvas Kit Skeleton

A Skeleton is a low-fidelity visual placeholder that represents the loading of interface elements
before they have displayed on the page. Appearing as a blank version of the incoming content, it
mitigates focus on the loading process and improves the user’s perceived load time.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Skeleton includes a container `Skeleton` component and the following subcomponents:
`Skeleton.Header`, `Skeleton.Text`, and `Skeleton.Shape`. Each subcomponent can be used as a
placeholder for a particular type of content.

Here's an example of how you might compose Skeleton components (along with non-Skeleton components
such as `Box` and `Flex`) to create a loading placeholder for a piece of content comprised of an
icon, a heading, and some text.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

And here's an example that simulates how that Skeleton might work in practice.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Simulation} />

Press the **Simulate Loading** button to simulate the loading of the content (customize the loading
time using the **Load Time** field), or check the **Loading** check box to force the Skeleton to
display.

### Color

All Skeleton subcomponents accept a `backgroundColor` prop which can be used to specify the color of
the subcomponent. This is generally only recommended to be used for dark or gray backgrounds to
ensure the Skeleton components are visible.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Color} />

### Text

`Skeleton.Text` renders a placeholder for text content such as paragraphs. Each placeholder line has
a width of `100%` and a fixed height of `21px`, with the last line having a width of `60%` if there
are multiple lines.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Text} />

### Header

`Skeleton.Header` renders a placeholder for header content such as headings.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Header} />

### Shape

`Skeleton.Shape` renders a placeholder for graphic elements such as icons, avatars and small images.
Set the `height`, `width`, and `borderRadius` props of the `Skeleton.Shape` to create various
rectangular and circular shapes.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Shape} />
