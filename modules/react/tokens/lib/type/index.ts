 *
 * - `levels` - provide higher-level styles for the Canvas type hierarchy: title, heading, body, and subtext
 * - `properties` - provide low-level type properties (font families, sizes, and weights)
 * - `variants` - provide modifiers for text styles (error, hint, and inverse)

  /** ### Font Family Tokens
   * [View Storybook Docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/tokens-tokens-react--type)
   *
   * ---
   * There are two font family tokens:
   *
   * - `default`: "Roboto" - what you'll almost always want to choose
   * - `monospace`: "Roboto Mono" - what you'll want for monospace type
   *
   * You can find more detailed information by inspecting individual families.
   * @example
   * ```tsx
   * import { type } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';
   *
   * const MonospaceText = () => (
   *   <p css={{fontFamily: type.properties.fontFamilies.monospace}}>
   *     monospace_text
   *   </p>
   * );
   * ```

  /** ### Font Size Tokens
   * [View Storybook Docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/tokens-tokens-react--type)
   *
   * ---
   * There are twelve font size tokens. Here's a quick reference:
   *
   * `10`, `12`, `14`, `16`, `18`, `20`, `24`, `28`, `32`, `40`, `48`, `56`
   *
   * Each token key corresponds to a pixel value. So if you're looking for a token
   * that matches 16px, you'd grab the `fontSizes[16]` token.
   *
   * Note that the value of each token is converted to base-16 rem. For example:
   *
   * ```ts
   * fontSizes[16] \\ returns '1rem'
   * ```
   * You can find more detailed information by inspecting individual font sizes.
   *
   * @example
   * ```tsx
   * import { type } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';
   *
   * const LargeText = () => (
   *   <p css={{fontSize: type.properties.fontSizes[20]}}>
   *     Bold Text
   *   </p>
   * );
   * ```

  /** ### Font Weight Tokens
   * [View Storybook Docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/tokens-tokens-react--type)
   *
   * ---
   * There are three font-weight tokens:
   *
   * - `regular` (400)
   * - `medium` (500)
   * - `bold` (700)
   *
   * Each token maps a weight name to a number value.
   *
   * @example
   * ```tsx
   * import { type } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';
   *
   * const BoldText = () => (
   *   <p css={{fontWeight: type.properties.fontWeights.bold}}>
   *     Bold Text
   *   </p>

  /** ### Canvas Type Hierarchy
   * [View Storybook Docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/tokens-tokens-react--type)
   *
   * ---
   * The hierarchy is organized into four levels, which correspond to levels defined in Figma.
   *
   * - `title`: Intended to be used for large page titles.
   * - `heading`: Intended to be used for headings and large text.
   * - `body`: Intended to be used for standard body text.
   * - `subtext`: Intended to be used for small subtext content or in tight spaces.
   *
   * Each level has three sizes: `large`, `medium`, and `small`.
   *
   * The type hierarchy tokens are recommended for most type usage.
   * These objects handle font sizes, weights, line heights, letter spacing, and color for you,
   * making it really simple to implement consistent type without much effort
   *
   * You can find more detailed information by inspecting individual levels and sizes.
   *
   * @example
   * ```tsx
   * import { type } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';
   *
   * const Heading = () => (
   *   <h3 css={type.levels.heading.medium}>
   *     Heading Text
   *   </h3>
   * );

  /** ### Canvas Type Variants
   * [View Storybook Docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/tokens-tokens-react--type)
   *
   * ---
   * There are three type variants:
   *
   * - `error` Used for making errors more visible
   * - `hint` Used for help text and secondary content
   * - `inverse` Used for any text on a dark or colored background
   *
   * Type variants provide modifiers for text styles.
   * They are typically used in conjunction with other type styles
   * such as the type hierarchy and type properties tokens.
   * You can find more detailed information by inspecting individual variants.
   *
   * @example
   * ```tsx
   * import { type } from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';
   *
   * const ErrorText = () => (
   *   <span css={{...type.levels.subtext.small, ...type.variants.error}}>
