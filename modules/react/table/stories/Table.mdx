# Canvas Kit Table

`Table` is a simple styled compound component that renders a
[table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element. It is used to
present information in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing
data. `Table` is built off of `BaseTable` and is using
[CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) features.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Users may not want to use a `caption` so they can import
[Heading](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-text-heading--docs) or
[Text](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-text-text--docs) instead. This
will give the user more flexibility around the customization of the title/heading of their table.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BasicWithHeading} />

### Right to Left

Table supports right-to-left languages when specified in the CanvasProvider theme.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RightToLeft} />

### Example with Caption

Users are free to use a `caption` instead of a heading. A `caption` is not required but it is good
for
[accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table#accessibility_concerns)
purposes.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Fixed Column

Users may add styles to the `Table.Header` to render a fixed column. The example below assigns a
`width` to the `Table` to guarantee the fixed column is triggered, but you are free to omit the
`width` if you would only like the fixed column to be triggered if necessary.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FixedColumn} />

### Base Html Table Example

If a user needs a standard HTML
[table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) with no
[CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) features, then they can
use the `BaseTable` component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BaseHtmlTable} />

### Which Component Should I Use?

> If a user wants [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout)
> features with their Table, then use the
> [Table](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-containers-table--docs#basic-example)
> component.

> If a user **does not** want
> [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) features with their
> Table, then use the
> [BaseTable](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-containers-table--docs#base-html-table-example)
> component.
