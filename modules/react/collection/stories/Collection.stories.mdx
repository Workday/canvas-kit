# Canvas Kit Collection API

The Collection API is a system of models and behaviors for creating lists and grids. For example,
`Tabs` uses collection behaviors and so does `Menu`. The UI of each looks very different, but much
of the behavior is shared. The Collection API should be used if a component doesn't already exist to
satisfy your needs.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### ListBox

The `ListBox` is a basic component that offers vertical rendering of a collection in the form of a
2-dimension list. It understands virtualization, rendering only visible items in the DOM while also
providing aria attributes to allow screen readers to still navigate virtual lists. The `ListBox`
contains a basic `ListBox.Item` that renders list items that render correctly with virtualization
and adds `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` for screen readers.

The `ListBox` is very basic and only adds enough functionality to render correctly. No additional
behaviors are added to navigate or select. React Hooks are provided to add this functionality and
are used by higher level components like `Menu` and `Menu.Item` which utilize `ListBox`.

#### Basic Example

The `ListBox` on its own isn't very useful. It registers each item with the model. The
`ListBox.Item` only uses the `useListItemRegister` hook which handles registration of static items
to the model. The `ListBox` uses `useListRenderItems` which handles rendering static items as well
as [Dynamic List](#dynamic-list) example).

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

#### Identifying Items

A list item takes an optional `data-id` property that will be used to identify an item. Without a
`data-id`, the identifier will be the item's index when first registered. The basic example has a
`data-id` attribute that is a string representation of the index. Providing a `data-id` will
override to a value of your choosing. This identifier will be used by other hooks to identify the
item for selection, maintaining a cursor, or anything else.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={IdentifiedItems} />

#### Dynamic Items

The `ListBox` also handles a dynamic collection of items. Instead of providing each `ListBox.Item`
statically, provide a render function instead. The function is called with an `items` value that is
the same was what's provided to the model. By default, providing items will enable virtualization.
This example adds a `maxHeight` to ensure overflow. Virtualization uses absolute positioning of each
item, which could cause problems for popup menus. If your item count is low, pass
`shouldVirtualize={false}` to disable virtualization.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={DynamicItems} />

### List Model

The List model contains the the state and events necessary to track items, selection, and a cursor.
Various hooks can be used for a List model to create common behaviors associated with lists, such as
navigating a list with a keyboard, selection (single and multiple), and virtualization.

A list also has a "cursor". A cursor is often represented by focus, but it is not always a 1:1
mapping. Think of the cursor as the focus item within the list. If the list has browser focus, the
cursor will map to browser focus. Behaviors such as `useListRovingFocus` will map the cursor to the
active tab stop of the list. For more information, see
[Roving Tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex). `useListRovingFocus`
adds keyboard events that map to navigation events. A [Navigation Manager](#navigation-manager) is
used to map new cursor ids to these events. The `ListModel` takes an optional `navigation`
configuration to change the default navigation behavior. The default navigation manager is a
[wrappingNavigationManager](#wrappingnavigationmanager) meaning the cursor will wrap around the
beginning and the ends. The cursor also provides a [navigationManager](#navigationmanager) that does
not wrap. This is the default navigation for grids.

The cursor also adds the concept of `orientation` which defaults to `'vertical'`. A Tab list is an
example of a `'horizontal'` list.

### Grid

A Cursor List can become a grid if a `columnCount` is provided. The array of items is still flat,
but navigational controls are now in two dimensions instead of one. A one dimension list is
bidirectionally aware, but a grid will always

#### Navigation Manager

#### Roving Tabindex

The list system also includes a cursor that extends the list. A cursor is mostly used for focusing
items. The [roving tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex) is a
well-supported way to accomplish accessibility requirements for focusing items within a list. This
example shows how to use `useListRovingFocus`. This example uses the `ListBox` component, but the
default `ListBox.Item` is very basic. We have two options, we can either pass additional
functionality via `elemPropsHook` or by creating a new item using our elemProps hook primitives.
Both will be demonstrated. Creating a custom item is recommended if you create a custom component
and export it. Using `elemPropsHook` with `ListBox.Item` is recommended only for one-off instances.

You can either use the tab key for focus on an item or click on an item and then use the up/down
keys to navigation the list. By default, the list is set to wrap navigation using the
`wrappingNavigationManager`. Only a single item in the list is a focus stop that "roves" as the
up/down arrows are pressed.

**Note:** This example doesn't meet accessibility requirements. The list will have to have some type
of context. Like "navigation list" or "menu list".

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RovingFocus} />

#### Selection

Lists support selection. `useSelectionItem` is applied to an item which adds an `onClick` that adds
the item to the `state.selectedIds`. The default selection manager is a single select. This example
uses `ListBox` and creates a custom `SelectableItem` elemProps hook and component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Selection} />

#### Multiple Selection

Lists support selection. `useSelectionItem` is applied to an item which adds an `onClick` that adds
the item to the `state.selectedIds`. The default selection manager is a single select.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={MultiSelection} />
