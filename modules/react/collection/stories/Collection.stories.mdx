# Canvas Kit Collection API

The Collection API is a system of models and behaviors for creating lists and grids. For example,
`Tabs` uses collection behaviors and so does `Menu`. The UI of each looks very different, but much
of the behavior is shared. The Collection API should be used if a component doesn't already exist to
satisfy your needs.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

The `ListBox` on its own isn't very useful. It registers each item with the model. The
`ListBox.Item` only uses the `useListItemRegister` hook which handles registration of static items
to the model. The `ListBox` uses `useListRenderItems` which handles rendering static items as well
as [Dynamic List](#dynamic-list) example).

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Identifying Items

A list item takes an optional `data-id` property that will be used to identify an item. Without a
`data-id`, the identifier will be the item's index when first registered. The basic example has a
`data-id` attribute that is a string representation of the index. Providing a `data-id` will
override to a value of your choosing. This identifier will be used by other hooks to identify the
item for selection, maintaining a cursor, or anything else.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={IdentifiedItems} />

### Dynamic Items

The `ListBox` also handles a dynamic collection of items. Instead of providing each `ListBox.Item`
statically, provide a render function instead. The function is called with an `items` value that is
the same was what's provided to the model. By default, providing items will enable virtualization.
This example adds a `maxHeight` to ensure overflow. Virtualization uses absolute positioning of each
item, which could cause problems for popup menus. If your item count is low, pass
`shouldVirtualize={false}` to disable virtualization.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={DynamicItems} />

#### Roving Tabindex

The list system also includes a cursor that extends the list. A cursor is mostly used for focusing
items. The [roving tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex) is a
well-supported way to accomplish accessibility requirements for focusing items within a list. This
example shows how to use `useListRovingFocus`. This example uses the `ListBox` component, but the
default `ListBox.Item` is very basic. We have two options, we can either pass additional
functionality via `elemPropsHook` or by creating a new item using our elemProps hook primitives.
Both will be demonstrated. Creating a custom item is recommended if you create a custom component
and export it. Using `elemPropsHook` with `ListBox.Item` is recommended only for one-off instances.

You can either use the tab key for focus on an item or click on an item and then use the up/down
keys to navigation the list. By default, the list is set to wrap navigation using the
`wrappingNavigationManager`. Only a single item in the list is a focus stop that "roves" as the
up/down arrows are pressed.

**Note:** This example doesn't meet accessibility requirements. The list will have to have some type
of context. Like "navigation list" or "menu list".

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RovingFocus} />

#### Selection

Lists support selection. `useSelectionItem` is applied to an item which adds an `onClick` that adds
the item to the `state.selectedIds`. The default selection manager is a single select. This example
uses `ListBox` and creates a custom `SelectableItem` elemProps hook and component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Selection} />

#### Multiple Selection

The `selection` manager can be passed directly to the model configuration to handle different
selection types. This example passes the `multiSelectionManager` to handle selecting multiple items.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={MultiSelection} />

### Basic Grid

A grid is a two dimensional list. A `columnCount` config is added to inform how to break up an array
of items. A grid is very similar to a list - it receives items as a single dimension list and uses
the `columnCount` to determine keyboard navigation. Grids only support a single orientation.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BasicGrid} />

#### Wrapping Grid

By default, navigating a grid does not wrap around when the user reaches the end of a row or column.
The grid model supports passing in a navigation manager. The collection system supports two types of
navigation managers, a non-wrapping `navigationManager` and the `wrappingNavigationManager`. The
following example passes the `wrappingNavigationManager` manager to the model. Observe how the
cursor wraps around columns and rows when an edge of a column or row is encountered.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WrappingGrid} />

## Components

### ListBox

#### Usage

The `ListBox` is a basic component that offers vertical rendering of a collection in the form of a
2-dimension list. It understands virtualization, rendering only visible items in the DOM while also
providing aria attributes to allow screen readers to still navigate virtual lists. The `ListBox`
contains a basic `ListBox.Item` that renders list items that render correctly with virtualization
and adds `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` for screen readers.

The `ListBox` is very basic and only adds enough functionality to render correctly. No additional
behaviors are added to navigate or select. React Hooks are provided to add this functionality and
are used by higher level components like `Menu` and `Menu.Item` which utilize `ListBox`.

#### Props

<ArgsTable of={ListBox} />

### ListBox.Item

#### Usage

The `ListBox.Item` is a simple placeholder for listbox items. The functionality of a collection item
varies between components. For example, a `Tabs.Item` and a `Menu.Item` have shared functionality,
but have different behavior. All collection-based components should implement a custom `Item`
subcomponent using the collection-based behavior hooks. The [Roving Tabindex](#roving-tabindex)
example uses the `elemPropsHook` to provide additional functionality. `elemPropsHook` is provided on
all compound components and is useful in the example to add additional functionality without making
a new component.

#### Props

<ArgsTable of={ListBox.Item} />

## Models

There are two supported models based on the collection system.

### `useListModel`

The List model contains the the state and events necessary to track items, selection, and a cursor.
Various hooks can be used for a List model to create common behaviors associated with lists, such as
navigating a list with a keyboard, selection (single and multiple), and virtualization.

A list also has a "cursor". A cursor is often represented by focus, but it is not always a 1:1
mapping. Think of the cursor as the focus item within the list. If the list has browser focus, the
cursor will map to browser focus. Behaviors such as `useListRovingFocus` will map the cursor to the
active tab stop of the list. For more information, see
[Roving Tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex). `useListRovingFocus`
adds keyboard events that map to navigation events. A [Navigation Manager](#navigation-manager) is
used to map new cursor ids to these events. The `ListModel` takes an optional `navigation`
configuration to change the default navigation behavior. The default navigation manager is a
[wrappingNavigationManager](#wrappingnavigationmanager) meaning the cursor will wrap around the
beginning and the ends. The cursor also provides a [navigationManager](#navigationmanager) that does
not wrap. This is the default navigation for grids.

The cursor also adds the concept of `orientation` which defaults to `'vertical'`. A Tab list is an
example of a `'horizontal'` list.

#### Config

<ArgsTable of={ListModelConfigComponent} />

#### State

<ArgsTable of={ListStateComponent} />

#### Events

<ArgsTable of={ListEventsComponent} />

### `useGridModel`

The Grid model extends the List model and changes some config. For example, the `columnCount` is
required on the grid model's configuration and `orientation` is removed.

#### Config

<ArgsTable of={GridModelConfigComponent} />

#### State

<ArgsTable of={GridStateComponent} />

#### Events

<ArgsTable of={GridEventsComponent} />

### Navigation Manager

The list and grid models accept a `navigation` config. If one is not provided, a default will be
chosen. It is possible to create a custom navigation manager to hand to the model if the default
doesn't work.

<ArgsTable of={NavigationManager} />

```ts
type NavigationRequestor = <T>(id: string, model: Model) => Item<T>;

interface Item<T> {
  index: number;
  id: string;
  value: T;
  /**
   * Used by components that allow jumping to an item based on typing
   */
  textValue?: string;
}
```

#### `navigationManager`

The `navigationManager` implements the [Navigation Manager](#navigation-manager) interface for lists
and grids, but does not wrap when the user hits a boundary of the collection. This is the default
navigation manager for grids.

#### `wrappingNavigationManager`

The `wrappingNavigationManager` implements the [Navigation Manager](#navigation-manager) interface
for lists and grids, and wraps when the user hits a boundary of the collection. Grids will wrap
columns, but not rows. This is the default navigation manager for lists.

### Selection Manager

The list and grid models accept a `selection` config. If one is not provided, `singleSelectManager`
is used. You can provide a custom select manager to suite your needs. A selection manager is an
object with a single `select` method that takes an id and previously selected ids and returns a new
set of selected ids.

The collection system provides two selection managers: `singleSelectManager` and
`multiSelectionManager`.

```ts
interface Selection {
  selectedIds: 'all' | string[];
  unselectedIds: string[];
}

interface SelectionManager {
  select(id: string, prevState: Selection): Selection;
}
```

## Hooks

### `useListItemRegister`

This elemProps hook is the base of all item component hooks. It registers an item with a collection
and sets the `data-id` that is used by other hooks. It should always be the last defined hook when
using `composeHooks` (`composeHooks` executes hooks right to left and merges props left to right).
It is used by `ListBox.Item` and all `*.Item` subcomponents.

```ts
const useMyItem = composeHooks(
  useListItemSelect, // additional hooks go here
  useListItemRegister // always last
);
```

### `useListItemRovingFocus`

This elemProps hook is used for cursor navigation by using
[Roving Tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex). Only a single item in
the collection has a tab stop. Pressing an arrow key moves the tab stop to a different item in the
corresponding direction. See the [Roving Tabindex](#roving-tabindex) example. This elemProps hook
should be applied to an `*.Item` component.

```ts
const useMyItem = composeHooks(
  useListItemRovingFocus, // adds the roving tabindex support
  useListItemRegister
);
```

### `useListItemSelect`

This elemProps hook adds selection support to a `*.Item` subcomponent of a collection. It adds a
click handler that toggles selection status according to the [Selection Manager](#selection-manager)
used.

```ts
const useMyItem = composeHooks(
  useListItemSelect, // adds selection support to an item
  useListItemRegister
);
```

### `useListRenderItem`

```ts
declare function useListRenderItem<T>(
  model: Model,
  children: React.ReactNode | ((item: T, index: number) => React.ReactNode)
): React.ReactNode;
```

This hook is meant to be used inside the render function of `List` style components. It is used by
`ListBox`. This hook gives list-based components their static and dynamic APIs to handle list items.
This hook should only be used if you want to implement your own List. For example, `Tabs.List` uses
this hook, but `Menu.List` uses `ListBox` which uses this hook.

```tsx
const MyList = createContainer('ul')({
  modelHook: useListModel,
})((elemProps, Element, model) => {
  return <Element {...elemProps}>{useListRenderItems(model, elemProps.children)}</Element>;
});
```

### `useListResetCursorOnBlur`

This elemProps hook resets the cursor when the list looses focus. By default,
[useListItemRovingFocus](#use-list-item-roving-focus) will leave the last focused item as the
focusable item in the list. Sometimes it is desireable to reset the cursor to the last selected
item. For example, `Tabs.Item` uses this hook to reset the tab stop to the currently selected tab.

```ts
const useMyItem = composeHooks(
  useListResetCursorOnBlur, // adds the cursor reset to selected for roving tabindex
  useListItemRovingFocus,
  useListItemRegister
);
```
