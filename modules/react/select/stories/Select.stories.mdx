# Canvas Kit Select

Select menus allow users to choose one option from a list of items.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/inputs/select-drop-down)

> Consider using the [Select in Preview](/docs/preview-select-react-top-label--default) instead. It
> utilizes a Canvas-styled menu with theming support and a more flexible API for defining options.
> The Select in Preview will replace this component in the future.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Select should be used in tandem with [Form Field](/docs/components-inputs-form-field-react--basic)
to meet accessibility standards.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Disabled

Set the `disabled` prop of the Select to prevent users from interacting with it.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Disabled} />

You may also set the `disabled` prop of the Select Option to prevent users from selecting that
Option. Note that the value of a Select may be programmatically set to a disabled Option by setting
the Select's `value` prop to the value of the disabled Option. The disabled Option, however, will
remain unselectable by the user.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={DisabledOption} />

### Ref Forwarding

Select supports [ref forwarding](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html). It will forward
`ref` to its underlying `<select>` element.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RefForwarding} />

### Grow

Set the `grow` prop of the wrapping Form Field to `true` to configure the Select to expand to the
width of its container.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Grow} />

The `grow` prop may also be applied directly to the Select if Form Field is not being used.

### Label Position

Set the `labelPosition` prop of the wrapping Form Field to designate the position of the label
relative to the Select. `labelPosition` accepts the following values:

- `FormField.LabelPosition.Top` (Default)
- `FormField.LabelPosition.Left`

<ExampleCodeBlock code={LabelPosition} />

### Required

Set the `required` prop of the wrapping Form Field to `true` to indicate that the field is required.
Labels for required fields are suffixed by a red asterisk.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Required} />

### Error States

Set the `error` prop of the wrapping Form Field to `FormField.ErrorType.Alert` or
`FormField.ErrorType.Error` to set the Select to the Alert or Error state, respectively. You will
also need to set the `hintId` and `hintText` props on the Form Field to meet accessibility
standards.

The `error` prop may be applied directly to the Select with a value of `Select.ErrorType.Alert` or
`Select.ErrorType.Error` if Form Field is not being used.

#### Alert

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Alert} />

#### Error

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Error} />

## Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `<select>` element.

<ArgsTable of={Select} />
