on Storybook.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/inputs/select-drop-down)

> Consider using the
> [Select in Preview](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/preview-select-react-top-label--default)
> instead. It utilizes a Canvas-styled menu with theming support and a more flexible API for
> defining options. The Select in Preview will replace this component in the future.
