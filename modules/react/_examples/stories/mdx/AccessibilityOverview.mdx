## Accessibility Overview Coming Soon!

Canvas Kit is built with accessibility in mind. We continuously strive to provide a robust set of
accessible components that are easy to customize for your specific needs.

## The Accessibility Tree

The Accessibility Tree is created by the web browser from the semantic information provided in the
document object model (DOM). It's like a simplified outline containing only the most important
information: the elements on the page, what they are (e.g., a button, a link, a heading), and what
they do. This tree is what a screen reader uses to tell a person what's on the page and how to
interact with it.

- `name:` a.k.a. “Label” describes the purpose of an element. (E.g. text fields provided for first
  name, last name, and street address.)
- `role:` describes what an element is and how it can be used. (E.g. a text field, radio button
  group, or single checkbox.)
- `state:` describes the current state of an element. (E.g. whether a text field is empty or
  displaying text.)

## Accessible Names and Descriptions

Giving an element an **accessible name** is like giving it a label. It's a short phrase, like
"Search" or "Submit," that a screen reader uses to tell a person what an item is. This helps a user
understand the element's purpose and tell it apart from other items on the page. Some items, like
buttons and links, are required to have an accessible name. You can also add an **accessible
description** if you need to provide more information. This could be instructions for a form field
or a longer explanation of what a button does. A screen reader will read the name first, and then
the description, giving the user all the information they need to understand and use the element.

## `<AccessibleHide>` Component

```
<AccessibleHide>
  This text is hidden using CSS and still available to screen readers.
</Accessibility>
```

## `<AriaLiveRegion>` Component

```
<AriaLiveRegion>
  When this text is updated, screen readers will announce it in live time.
</AriaLiveRegion>
```

Sometimes, things change on a webpage without the whole page reloading. Think of a live sports score
that updates every few seconds or a search result that appears as you type. For users of screen
readers, these changes can be missed because the screen reader doesn't know to look for them. This
is where **ARIA live regions** come in. An ARIA live region is a special area on a webpage that
tells a screen reader to pay close attention to it. When the content in this area changes, the
screen reader automatically announces the update to the user. This ensures that everyone, including
those using assistive technology, is kept aware of important, real-time changes on the page.

[Aria Live Region Examples](?path=/docs/guides-accessibility-examples-aria-live-regions--docs) for
more detailed information about this topic.

## `useUniqueId()` Hook

This handy utility function is useful anytime a unique ID is needed for assigning labels,
descriptions, or for anything else in the web application.

```
/**
In this example, we use 'aria-labelledby' on the table container
instead of using HTML <caption> to assign a name for the table.
*/
const tableHeadingId = useUniqueId();
...
<Heading id={tableHeadingId}> Pizza Toppings </Heading>
...
<Table aria-labelledby={tableHeadingId}>
  /* table rows */
</Table>

```

## `px2rem()` Function

This is another handy utility function that will convert pixel units into relative units. Using the
[Canvas Token System](?path=/docs/guides-tokens-migration-overview--docs) is strongly recommended
first, this is a nice convertion function if a space token isn't feasible.

```
/**
* In this example, we wanted the main content region
* of the grid to have a height of 800px.
*/
const gridLayoutStyles = createStyles({
  ...
  gridTemplateRows: `auto ${px2rem(800)} auto`,
});
```

## Responsiveness and Reflow

**WCAG v2.2 success criterion 1.4.10 Reflow states:**

> _“Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring
> scrolling in two dimensions for vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels
> and horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. ”_

Of course, there are exceptions to this guideline, including tables that do not apply. (Source:
[Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html))
In general, we have 2 key recommendations for satisfying this guideline:

1. Do not specify a minimum width greater than `320px` to avoid unnecessary horizontal scroll.
2. Do not use any sticky headers or footers at the smallest responsive breakpoints.

### How we test against this guideline:

Set the browser viewport to `1280px x 1024px` and increase browser zoom to 400%. This is
mathetmatically equivalent to a width of 320 and a height of 256 CSS pixels.

- Evaluate whether any horizontal scroll isn't necessary in the application.
- Evaluate whether there is any loss of function due to sticky content.
- Look for clipping and overlapping content.
