## Contextual Help

### Tooltip
A Canvas Kit `Tooltip` can be used to provide additional information about why an element is disabled. 
We should not, however, put one directly onto a disabled element because disabled elements do not receive focus
(meaning the tooltip content is not accessible to keyboard users). Instead, we should provide a button next to the disabled
element and apply the `Tooltip` to the button.

**Note: We should avoid passing the `type` prop to the `Tooltip`. The default behavior is to assign an `aria-label` to the button
(which is what we want)**

### Contextual Help Popup Without Focus Trap
If one would like to provide a bit more content than a `Tooltip` will allow (such as buttons or links) a popup should be used.
In this example, a `Dialog` is used in conjunction with the `useFocusRedirect` hook to display some text and a link. It will
not trap focus; instead, it will close and focus the next element if the user tabs out or clicks away. A `Tooltip` is still
used on the `Dialog.Target` component so that it remains accessible for screen readers.

`Dialog` inserts an invisible `<div>` element right after the button with an `aria-owns` attribute pointing to the 
`Dialog.Card`. This allows screen readers to read the popup contents in a logical order with the target. In other words, the 
screen reader will announce the `Dialog` right after the open button instead of out of order.

Additionally, we apply `aria-describedby` to our `Dialog.Target` to associate it with the `FormField.Label`.

### Contextual Help Dialog With Focus Trap
The `useFocusTrap` hook can be used in contextual help where trapping focus within the `Dialog` is the goal. In this case, 
focus will remain in the `Dialog` until it is closed. This example is otherwise identical to the one above.
