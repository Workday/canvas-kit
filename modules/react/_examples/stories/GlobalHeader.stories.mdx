# GlobalHeader Example

Developers building internal Workday applications will likely not need to create this component.
However, if you're building components to be used outside of Workday, this is a helpful reference
for building a global navigation header that looks like our internal `GlobalHeader`.

## Tooltip usage

- The `default` variant Tooltip is used on all of the icon buttons, which will automatically set the
  Tooltip's text to the accessible name. (`aria-label`)
- The `describe` variant Tooltip is used instead on the "MENU" button because this is a text button.
  The Tooltip's text "Global Navigation" will instead be assigned to the accessible description to
  ensure that the visible button text "MENU" is not overriden.
