# GlobalHeader Example

Developers building internal Workday applications will likely not need to create this component.
However, if you're building components to be used outside of Workday, this is a helpful reference
for building a global navigation header that looks like our internal `GlobalHeader`.

## Tooltip usage

- The `default` variant Tooltip is used on all of the icon buttons, which will automatically set the
  Tooltip's text to the accessible name. (`aria-label`)
- The `describe` variant Tooltip is used instead on the "MENU" button because this is a text button.
  The Tooltip's text "Global Navigation" will instead be assigned to the accessible description to
  ensure that the visible button text "MENU" is not overriden.

## Count badge usage

When `<CountBadge>` is used as a sibling component for button, the `aria-describedby` property is
set on the button referencing the `id` value of the `<CountBadge>`. This practice helps support
users depending on screen readers to describe both the name of the button and the value of the
`<CountBadge>`.

When a web app dynamically updates count badges in real-time, consider the following accessibility
enhancements to support live, real-time announcements for screen readers:

- The `<CountBadge>` component is rendered as a child of the `<AriaLiveRegion>` container.
- The `<AriaLiveRegion>` container is assigned a name by using `aria-labelledby` to reference the
  name of the icon button `"Notifications"`.
- The `<AccessibleHide>` component is used following the `<CountBadge>` to render a hidden word
  "new" that only screen reader users can access.
- When the `<CountBadge>` is updated, then screen readers can automatically describe (in real-time)
  the name of the live region, "Notifications" and the text updated inside of it, "1 new".
