# Canvas Kit Action Bar

Full width toolbar fixed to bottom of screen.

Although not required, [buttons](../../button/react) are often used in in action bars. The primary
action button should be left aligned followed by secondary buttons. The primary button is on the
right only in task orchestration and on mobile devices.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button';
import {ActionBar} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/action-bar';

<ActionBar>
  <PrimaryButton variant="primary">Button</PrimaryButton>
  <SecondaryButton>Button</SecondaryButton>
  <SecondaryButton>Button</SecondaryButton>
</ActionBar>;
```

## Static Properties

> None

## Component Props

### Required

> None

### Optional

#### `fixed: boolean`

> Fixes the toolbar to the bottom of the window (uses `position: fixed`)

## Responsive Behavior

At 575px, responsive styles will take effect:

- Applies a flex box to the buttons
- Makes single-button groups full width
- All buttons will become the same width (`flex: 1`).
- Button order will become reversed, making left-aligned primary buttons right-aligned.

> When on a mobile form factor, the button placement should flip to have the primary button on the
> far right.
