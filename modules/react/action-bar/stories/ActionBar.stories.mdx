# Canvas Kit Action Bar

Action Bar is a [compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/)
that contains primary and secondary actions related to a page or task.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/buttons/action-bar)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`ActionBar` includes a container `ActionBar` component and the following subcomponent:
`ActionBar.List` which should contains `ActionBar.Item`.

In a basic example of an `ActionBar` there are two buttons. The primary action button should be used
only once and left aligned if content is left to right, followed by secondary buttons. Tertiary
buttons should not be used in the Action Bar.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Icons Example

`ActionBar.Item` renders a `SecondaryButton` as default, so it's possible to use other Button props
with `ActionBar.Item` such as `icon` or `size`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Icons} />

### Delete Action Example

`ActionBar.Item` is a `SecondaryButton` by default but it's posible to change it to another element,
such as `DeleteButton`, by using `as` prop.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={DeleteAction} />

### Overflow Example

`ActionBar` container can contain up to 3 actions and an Overflow Menu if there are more than 3
actions, the other remaining actions should be placed into an Overflow Menu that is launched by
clicking the Overflow Button.

Also, ActionBar is a responsive component based on the width of its container. If the rendered
actions exceed the width of the `ActionBar.List`, an overflow menu will be rendered. This only works
against the dynamic API where you give the `ActionBarModel` an array of items to be rendered. The
dynamic API handles the React `key` for you based on the item's identifier. The dynamic API requires
either an `id` on each item object or a `getId` function that returns an identifier based on the
item. The below example uses an `id` property on each item.

The dynamic API takes in any object, but since nothing is known about your object, a
[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) is necessary to instruct a list how it
should render.

## Components

### ActionBar

#### Usage

`ActionBar` is a container component that is responsible for creating a `ActionBarModel` and sharing
it with its subcomponents using React context. It does not represent a real element.

```tsx
<ActionBar items={[]}>{/* Child components */}</ActionBar>
```

Alternatively, you may pass in a model using the hoisted model pattern.

```tsx
const model = useActionBarModel({
  items: [],
});

<ActionBar model={model}>{/* Child components */}</ActionBar>;
```

## Props

Note that if you pass in a `model` configured with `useActionBarModel`, configuration props passed
to `ActionBar` will be ignored.

<ArgsTable of={ActionBar} />

### ActionBar.List

#### Usage

`ActionBar.List` is a `HStack` element. It is a container for `ActionBar.Item` subcomponents. To
render an overflow button for ActionBar with overflow behavior `overflowButton` prop with overflow
button component as a value shold be passed.

```tsx
// without overflow
<ActionBar.List>{/* ActionBar.Items */}</ActionBar.List>

// with overflow
<ActionBar.List overflowButton={<ActionBar.OverflowButton aria-label="More actions"/>}>{
  /* ActionBar.Items */
}</ActionBar.List>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `HStack` element.

<ArgsTable of={ActionBar.List} />

### ActionBar.Item

#### Usage

`ActionBar.Item` is a `button` element, by default it's a `SecondaryButton` unless an `as` prop
passed.

```tsx
<ActionBar.Item as={PrimaryButton} onClick={() => console.log('first action')}>
  First Action
</ActionBar.Item>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `SecondaryButton` component.

<ArgsTable of={ActionBar.Item} />

## Model

If `ActionBar` was stripped of all its markup, attributes, and styling, what would remain is the
[model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#models). The model is an
object composed of two parts: `state` which describes the current snapshot in time of the component
and `events` which describes events that can be sent to the model.

By default, `ActionBar` will create a model and share it internally with its subcomponents using
React context. Alternatively, if you need direct access to the model's `state` and `events` outside
of the `ActionBar` component, you may configure your own model with `useActionBarModel` and pass it
to `ActionBar` via a pattern called
[hoisting the model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#configuring-a-model).

```tsx
const model = useActionBarModel({
  items: [],
});

<ActionBar model={model}>{/* Child components */}</ActionBar>;
```

### Config

`useActionBarModel` accepts a configuration object with the following properties and returns a
`ActionBarModel` with `state` and `events` properties.
