# Canvas Kit Action Bar

Action Bar is a [compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/)
that contains primary and secondary actions related to a page or task.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/buttons/action-bar)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`ActionBar` includes a container `ActionBar` component and the following subcomponent:
`ActionBar.List` which should contains `ActionBar.Item`.

In a basic example of an `ActionBar` there are two buttons. The primary action button should be used
only once and left aligned followed by secondary buttons. Tertiary Buttons should not be on the
Action Bar.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Icons Example

`ActionBar.Item` is a button, so it's possible to use other Button props with `ActionBar.Item` such
as `icon` or `size`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Icons} />

### Overflow Example

`ActionBar` container can contain up to 3 actions and an Overflow Menu if there are more than 3
actions. 4th item and other remaining actions should be placed into an Overflow Menu that is
launched by clicking the Overflow Button.

To using an overflow behavior in ActionBar `showOverflowButton` prop should be passed to
`ActionBar.List` and `ActionBar.Menu.Popper` structure should be placed inside `ActionBar`
component.

Also, ActionBar is a responsive component based on the width of its container. If the rendered
actions exceed the width of the `ActionBar.List`, an overflow menu will be rendered. This only works
against the dynamic API where you give the `ActionBarModel` an array of items to be rendered. The
dynamic API handles the React `key` for you based on the item's identifier. The dynamic API requires
either an `id` on each item object or a `getId` function that returns an identifier based on the
item. The below example uses an `id` property on each item.

The dynamic API takes in any object, but since nothing is known about your object, a
[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) is necessary to instruct a list how it
should render.

## Components

### ActionBar

#### Usage

`ActionBar` is a container component that is responsible for creating a `ActionBarModel` and sharing
it with its subcomponents using React context. It does not represent a real element.

```tsx
<ActionBar items={[]}>{/* Child components */}</ActionBar>
```

Alternatively, you may pass in a model using the hoisted model pattern.

```tsx
const model = useActionBarModel({
  items: [],
});

<ActionBar model={model}>{/* Child components */}</ActionBar>;
```

## Props

Note that if you pass in a `model` configured with `useActionBarModel`, configuration props passed
to `ActionBar` will be ignored.

<ArgsTable of={ActionBar} />

### ActionBar.List

#### Usage

`ActionBar.List` is a `HStack` element. It is a container for `ActionBar.Item` subcomponents. To
apply an overflow behavior for ActionBar `showOverflowButton` prop shold be true.

```tsx
<ActionBar.List>{/* ActionBar.Items */}</ActionBar.List>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `HStack` element.

<ArgsTable of={ActionBar.List} />

### ActionBar.Item

#### Usage

`ActionBar.Item` is a `button` element, by default it's a `SecondaryButton` unless `isPrimaryButton`
prop passed.

```tsx
<ActionBar.Item isPrimaryButton onClick={() => console.log('first action')}>
  First Action
</ActionBar.Item>
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `SecondaryButton` or `PrimaryButton` component.

<ArgsTable of={ActionBar.Item} />

## Model

If `ActionBar` was stripped of all its markup, attributes, and styling, what would remain is the
[model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#models). The model is an
object composed of two parts: `state` which describes the current snapshot in time of the component
and `events` which describes events that can be sent to the model.

By default, `ActionBar` will create a model and share it internally with its subcomponents using
React context. Alternatively, if you need direct access to the model's `state` and `events` outside
of the `ActionBar` component, you may configure your own model with `useActionBarModel` and pass it
to `ActionBar` via a pattern called
[hoisting the model](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/#configuring-a-model).

```tsx
const model = useActionBarModel({
  items: [],
});

<ActionBar model={model}>{/* Child components */}</ActionBar>;
```

### Config

`useActionBarModel` accepts a configuration object with the following properties and returns a
`ActionBarModel` with `state` and `events` properties.
