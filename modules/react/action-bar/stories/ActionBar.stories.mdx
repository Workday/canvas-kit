# Canvas Kit Action Bar

Action Bar contains primary and secondary actions related to a page or task.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here is a basic example of an `ActionBar` with two buttons. Although not required,
[buttons](../../button) are often used in in action bars. The primary action button should be used
only once and left aligned followed by secondary buttons.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

## Responsive Behavior

At 768px, responsive styles will take effect:

- All primary and secondary buttons will become the same width (`flex: 1`).
- Container Bar padding will be decreased to small (`16px`) for all sides.

## Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying `HStack` component.
