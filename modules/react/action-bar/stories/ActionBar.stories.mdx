# Canvas Kit Action Bar

Action Bar is a [compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/)
that contains primary and secondary actions related to a page or task.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/buttons/action-bar)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`ActionBar` includes a container `ActionBar` component and the following subcomponent:
`ActionBar.List` which should contains `ActionBar.Item`.

In a basic example of an `ActionBar` there are two buttons. The primary action button should be used
only once and left aligned if content is left to right, followed by secondary buttons. Tertiary
buttons should not be used in the Action Bar.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Icons Example

`ActionBar.Item` renders a `SecondaryButton` as default, so it's possible to use other Button props
with `ActionBar.Item` such as `icon` or `size`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Icons} />

### Delete Action Example

`ActionBar.Item` is a `SecondaryButton` by default but it's posible to change it to another element,
such as `DeleteButton`, by using `as` prop.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={DeleteAction} />

### Overflow Example

`ActionBar` container can contain up to 3 actions and an Overflow Menu if there are more than 3
actions, the other remaining actions should be placed into an Overflow Menu that is launched by
clicking the Overflow Button.

Also, ActionBar is a responsive component based on the width of its container. If the rendered
actions exceed the width of the `ActionBar.List`, an overflow menu will be rendered. This only works
against the dynamic API where you give the `ActionBarModel` an array of items to be rendered. The
dynamic API handles the React `key` for you based on the item's identifier. The dynamic API requires
either an `id` on each item object or a `getId` function that returns an identifier based on the
item. The below example uses an `id` property on each item.

The dynamic API takes in any object, but since nothing is known about your object, a
[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) is necessary to instruct a list how it
should render.

The number of visible buttons can also be adjusted by using the model's `maximumVisible` attribute.
You can change it from the default of 3 to any number greater than 1 and less than items.length.
