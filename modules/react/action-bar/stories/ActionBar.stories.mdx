# Canvas Kit Action Bar

Full width button toolbar fixed to bottom of screen.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here is a basic example of an `ActionBar` with two buttons. Although not required,
[buttons](../../button) are often used in in action bars. The primary action button should be left
aligned followed by secondary buttons. The primary button is on the right only in "progression-based
UIs" and on mobile devices.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Fixed

The Action Bar generally lives at the bottom of the viewport. If you would like this behavior
automatically (using `position: fixed`), you can use the `fixed` prop.

```tsx
<ActionBar fixed={true}>
  <PrimaryButton>Button</PrimaryButton>
  <SecondaryButton>Button</SecondaryButton>
</ActionBar>
```

## Responsive Behavior

At 575px, responsive styles will take effect:

- Applies a flex box to the buttons
- Makes single-button groups full width
- All buttons will become the same width (`flex: 1`).
- Button order will become reversed, making left-aligned primary buttons right-aligned.

> When on a mobile form factor, the button placement should flip to have the primary button on the
> far right.

## Props

Undocumented props are spread to the underlying container `<div>` element.

<ArgsTable of={ActionBar} />
