# Canvas Kit List

A list is a system of models and behaviors for creating lists. For example, `Tabs` uses list
behaviors and so does `Menu`. The UI of each looks very different, but much of the behavior is
shared.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

There is no `List` component, but components can be created using models and behaviors

### Basic Example

The list on its own isn't very useful. It registers each item with a `name` that is used by other
hooks (more on that later). `useRenderItems` provides rendering optimizations for rendering items.

### Roving Tabindex

The list system also includes a cursor that extends the list. A cursor is mostly used for focusing
items. The [roving tabindex](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#kbd_roving_tabindex) is a
well-supported way to accomplish accessibility requirements for focusing items within a list. This
example shows how to use `useRovingFocus`. You can either use the tab key for focus on an item or
click on an item and then use the up/down keys to navigation the list. By default, the list is set
to wrap navigation using the `wrappingNavigationManager`. Only a single item in the list is a focus
stop that "roves" as the up/down arrows are pressed.

**Note:** This example doesn't meet accessibility requirements. The list will have to have some type
of context. Like "navigation list" or "menu list".

### Selection

Lists support selection. `useSelectionItem` is applied to an item which adds an `onClick` that adds
the item to the `state.selectedIds`. The default selection manager is a single select.

### Multiple Selection

Lists support selection. `useSelectionItem` is applied to an item which adds an `onClick` that adds
the item to the `state.selectedIds`. The default selection manager is a single select.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={MultiSelection} />
