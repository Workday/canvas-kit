# Canvas Kit Card

Generic Canvas Card component. The card is a presentational
[compound component](../../../docs/mdx/COMPOUND_COMPONENTS.mdx) used as a building block for other
components, like Popups and Modals.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/containers/cards)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Simple Card

Cards have a `Card.Body` and an optional `Card.Heading`:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Default} />

### Padding

Padding of the card can be changed via the `padding` prop:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithNoPadding} />

### Depth

Card also takes `depth` levels, which changes the perceived "height above the canvas" of the card.
This changes the box shadow surrounding the card. Values are `inset`, or 0-4. Here's an inset card:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Depth} />

## Components

### Card

The `Card` component is the container component that holds a `Card.Body` and an optional
`Card.Heading`. The `Card` component wraps a non-semantic `div` element. The element can be replaced
using the `as` prop or a `role` or other `aria-*` attributes can be added to give the card container
semantic meaning.

#### Component Props

<ArgsTable of={Card} />

### Card.Heading

The `Card.Heading` component is an optional sub-component that is meant to describe the card. Since
the `Card` is a non-semantic presentational component, the `Card.Heading` does not automatically
have any semantic meaning. If your use-case requires the heading to label the card, you must do so
manually. For example, the `Modal` component uses a `Card`. It adds an `aria-labelledby` and a
`role` to the `Card` container component, then adds an `id` to the `Card.Heading` component:

```tsx
<Card role="dialog" aria-labelledby="card-heading">
  <Card.Heading id="card-heading">Card Title</Card.Heading>
  <Card.Body>Card Contents</Card.Body>
</Card>
```

The `Card.Heading` defaults to an `h3` element, but can be changed using the `as`:

```tsx
<Card.Heading as="h1">
```

#### Component Props

<ArgsTable of={Card.Heading} />

### Card.Body

The `Card.Body` component is a non-semantic sub-component that contains the body of the card. Any
attributes can be added to give the body any extra semantic meaning. If the body is very small, an
`aria-describedby` could be added to the `Card` container component that points to the `id` of this
sub-component. This might be useful in a short dialog.

The `Card.Body` defaults to a `div` element.

#### Component Props

<ArgsTable of={Card.Body} />
