# Canvas Kit Card

A Card is a preview that serves as an entry point to more detailed information. Card is a
presentational [compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/)
used as a building block for other components such as [Popup](/components/popups/popup/) and
[Modal](/components/popups/modal/).

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Card includes a container `Card` component and the following subcomponents: `Card.Body` and
`Card.Heading`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Depth

`Card` extends from `Box` so it supports all of
[Box's style props](/components/layout/box/#style-props). This includes `depth`, which changes the
Card's perceived "height" above the page surface by adjusting its box shadow. `Card` has a default
depth of `2`.

Here's an example of a `Card` with a reduced `depth` of `1`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Depth} />

### Padding

Set the `padding` prop of the `Card` (again, supported via `Box`) to adjust its padding. Card has a
default padding of `l`.

Here's an example of a `Card` with a reduced padding of `xs`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Padding} />

## Components

### Card

#### Usage

`Card` is a container component that holds a `Card.Body` and an optional `Card.Heading`. `Card`
wraps a non-semantic `div` element. The element can be replaced using the `as` prop, or a `role` or
other `aria-*` attributes can be added to give `Card` semantic meaning.

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the outermost element rendered by `Card`.

As mentioned earlier, `Card` extends from `Box` so it supports all of
[Box's style props](/components/layout/box/#style-props).

<ArgsTable of={Card} />

### Card.Heading

#### Usage

`Card.Heading` is an optional subcomponent that is meant to describe the Card. Since `Card` is a
non-semantic presentational component, `Card.Heading` does not automatically have any semantic
meaning. If your use case requires the Heading to label the Card, you must do so manually.

For example, Modal (which uses a `Card`) adds an `aria-labelledby` and a `role` to the `Card`, as
well as an `id` to the `Card.Heading`.

```tsx
<Card role="dialog" aria-labelledby="card-heading">
  <Card.Heading id="card-heading">Card Title</Card.Heading>
  <Card.Body>Card Contents</Card.Body>
</Card>
```

`Card.Heading` defaults to an `<h3>` element, but it can be changed using the `as` prop.

```tsx
<Card.Heading as="h1">
```

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the outermost element rendered by `Card.Heading`.

<ArgsTable of={Card.Heading} />

### Card.Body

#### Usage

`Card.Body` is a non-semantic subcomponent that contains the body of the card. Attributes may be
added to give `Card.Body` extra semantic meaning. If `Card.Body` is brief (like in a short dialog),
it may be helpful to add an `aria-describedby` referencing the `id` of the `Card.Body` to the `Card`
container.

`Card.Body` defaults to a `<div>` element.

#### Props

Undocumented props are spread to the outermost element rendered by `Card.Body`.

Like `Card`, `Card.Body` extends from `Box` so it supports all of
[Box's style props](/components/layout/box/#style-props).

<ArgsTable of={Card.Body} />
