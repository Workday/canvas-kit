# Canvas Kit Image

Represents an `img` element.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

## Basic

The `Image` component is useful when trying to render raster files or images that need additional styling like aspect ratio or object fit. It renders an `img` element and therefore you have access to all [attributes and props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) of a native `img` tag.

## Accessibility

### Alt Text (alt):
- Always provide descriptive alt text for images. This helps screen readers convey the purpose or content of the image to visually impaired users.
- Use meaningful descriptions that explain the image's context in the UI.
- If the image is decorative, use an empty alt attribute (alt=""), which signals assistive technologies to ignore the image.

### Captioning (caption):

- Include captions for images where additional explanatory text is required.
- Captions should be used for graphs, charts, or any image requiring a detailed explanation.

### Role and ARIA Attributes:

- Avoid adding ARIA roles such as role="img" unless the component uses non-standard HTML elements.
- Default `<img>` elements are already recognized as images.
- Use ARIA attributes only when needed (e.g., aria-describedby for complex images with external descriptions).
