   * - `PopupStack.bringToTop()` will also bring children to top as well using the `owner` reference

   *   popups that are brought to the front when clicked. This will prevent the "Window" from
   *   rendering on top of child popups as they will be brought along also.
   * - Synthetic event systems like in React will bubble events through "portals". This is
