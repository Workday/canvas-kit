## Stencil

Stencils are a reusable function that returns styles based on modifiers passed in. A Stencil should
apply to a single element. If your component has nested elements, you can either nest styles in the
stencil or create a stencil for each nested element. If your component is a compound component, a
stencil should be created for each subcomponet. If your component is a config component, a stencil
can have nested styles.
