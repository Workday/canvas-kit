## Style Merging

### Styling Precedence

In v9, we used `@emotion/styled` or `@emotion/react` for all styling which is a runtime styling
solution. Starting in v10, we're migrating our styling to a more static solution using
`createStyles` and the `cs` prop.

For a transition period, we're opting for backwards compatibility. If style props are present,
[styled components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) are used, or the
[css prop](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop) is used in a component, Emotion's style merging will be
invoked to make sure the following style precedence:

```
createStyles > CSS Prop > Styled Component > Style props
```

This will mean that any `css` prop or use of `styled` within the component tree _per element_ will
cause style class merging. For example:

```tsx
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import {createStyles} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {mergeStyles} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/layout';

const styles1 = createStyles({
  padding: 4,
});

const styles2 = createStyles({
  padding: 12,
});

const Component1 = props => {
  return <div {...mergeStyles(props, [styles1])} />;
};

const Component2 = props => {
  return <Component1 cs={styles2} />;
};

const Component3 = styled(Component1)({
  padding: 8,
});

const Component4 = props => {
  return <Component3 cs={styles2} />;
};

export default () => (
  <>
    <Component1 />
    <Component2 />
    <Component3 />
    <Component4 />
  </>
);
```

The `styled` component API is forcing `mergeStyles` to go into Emotion merge mode, which removes the
`style1` class name and creates a new class based on all the merged style properties. So
`.component3` is a new class created by Emotion at render time that merges `.style1` and
`{padding: 8px}`. `Component4` renders `Component3` with a `cs` prop, but `Component3` is already in
merge mode and so `Component4` will also merge all styles into a new class name of `.component4`
that has the styles from `.style1`, `.component3`, and `{padding: 12px}`:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    .styles1 {
      padding: 4px;
    }
    .styles2 {
      padding: 8px;
    }
    .component3 {
      padding: 4px;
      padding: 8px;
    }
    .component4 {
      padding: 4px;
      padding: 8px;
      padding: 12px;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<div class="styles1"></div>
<div class="styles1 styles2"></div>
<div class="component3"></div>
<div class="component4"></div>
```

The `css` prop and `styled` component APIs will rewrite the `className` React prop by iterating over
all class names and seeing if any exist within the cache. If a class name does exist in the cache,
the CSS properties are copied to a new style property map until all the class names are evaluated
and removed from the `className` prop. Emotion will then combine all the CSS properties and inject a
new `StyleSheet` with a new class name and add that class name to the element.

The following example shows this style merging.

CSS style property merging works by
[CSS specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity). If two matching
selectors have the same specificity, the last defined property wins. Stencils take advantage of this
by making all styles have the same specificity of `0-1-0` and inserting `base` styles, then
`modifiers` (in order), then `compound` modifiers (in order). This means if a property was defined
in `base`, a `modifier`, and a `compound` modifier, the `compound` modifier would win because it is
the last defined. This should be the expected order.

### `handleCsProp`

But what about when using components that use `@emotion/react` or `@emotion/styled`? Those libraries
use a different approach. Instead of multiple class names, they use a single, merged class name.

`handleCsProp` was created to handle integration with existing components that use the `css` prop
from `@emotion/react` or the `styled` components from `@emotion/styled`. If a class name from one of
those libraries is detected, style merging will follow the same rules as those libraries. Instead of
multiple class names, a single class name with all matching properties is created. The
`handleCsProp` also takes care of merging `style` props, `className` props, and can handle the `cs`
prop:

```tsx
const myStencil = createStencil({
  // ...
});

const MyComponent = elemProps => {
  return <div {...handleProps(elemProps, myStencil({}))} />;
};

// All props will be merged for you
<MyComponent style={{color: 'red'}} className="my-classname" cs={{position: 'relative'}} />;
```

`handleCsProp` will make sure the `style` prop is passed to the `div` and that the `my-classname`
CSS class name appears on the `div`'s class list. Also the `cs` prop will add the appropriate styles
to the element via a CSS class name. If your component needs to handle being passed a `className`,
`style`, or `cs` prop, use `handleCsProp`.
