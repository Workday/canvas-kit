## Styling Elements via Component Parts

The goal of compound components is to expose one component per semantic element. Most of the time
this means a 1:1 relationship of a component and DOM element. Sometimes a semantic element contains
non-semantic elements for styling. An example might be a `<button>` with a icon for visual
reinforcement, and a label for a semantic label. The semantic element is the `<button>` while the
icon has no semantic value and the label automatically provides the semantic button with an
accessible name. In order to style the icon and label elements, you have to know the DOM structure
to target those specific elements in order to style it.

```jsx
import {createStencil} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';

const myButtonStencil = createStencil({
  base: {
    background: 'transparent',
    i: {
      // ...icon styles
    },
    span: {
      // ...label styles
    },
    ':hover': {
      // ...hover button styles
      i: {
        // ...hover icon styles
      },
      span: {
        // ...hover label styles
      },
    },
  },
});

const MyButton = ({children, ...elemProps}) => {
  return (
    <button {...handleCsProp(elemProps, myButtonStencil())}>
      <i />
      <span>{children}</span>
    </button>
  );
};
```

## Using Component Parts to Style Elements

To style elements in the render function, we'll need to choose what elements to add the parts to. In
the example below, we're able to spread the parts directly to elements. The Stencil will generate
the type and value most appropriate for the context the part is used. In the Stencil, the part is
represented by a string that looks like `[data-part="{partValue}"]` and in the render function, it
is an object that looks like `{'data-part': partValue}`.

```jsx
import {createStencil, handleCsProp} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';

const myButtonStencil = createStencil({
  parts: {
    icon: 'my-button-icon',
    label: 'my-button-label',
  },
  base: ({iconPart, labelPart}) => ({
    background: 'transparent',
    [iconPart]: {
      // `[data-part="my-button-icon"]`
      // ...icon styles
    },
    [labelPart]: {
      // `[data-part="my-button-label"]`
      // ...label styles
    },
    '&:hover': {
      // ...hover styles for button element
      [iconPart]: {
        // ...hover styles for icon part
      },
    },
  }),
});

const MyButton = ({children, ...elemProps}) => {
  return (
    <button {...handleCsProp(elemProps, myButtonStencil())}>
      <i {...myButtonStencil.parts.icon} /> {/* data-part={my-button-icon} */}
      <span {...myButtonStencil.parts.label}>{children}</span> {/* data-part={my-button-label} */}
    </button>
  );
};
```

As a reusable component, you can use component parts to style elements that are not exposed in the
API. Consumers can also use the type safe Stencil to target that element to style it as well. As a
general rule, a Stencil maps to a component. Multiple Stencils per component usually means nested
elements that are not targets for style overrides.

> **Note:** While component parts are a way to give access to elements in order to style, they
> should be used sparingly. Using component parts increases CSS specificity. A component part should
> not be used on a nested component that has its own Stencil. The result will be any style
> properties defined with a component part will have a higher specificity than other styles.
