# Canvas Kit Styling

## Introduction

Canvas Kit styling is a custom CSS-in-JS solution that provides both a runtime for development and a static parsing process for build time. This system offers several key benefits:

- TypeScript autocomplete for enhanced developer experience
- Low runtime overhead for better performance
- Static CSS compilation for optimized builds
- Dynamic styling with CSS Variables for flexible design

The motivation behind this custom styling solution stems from the need to move beyond IE11 support and implement performance improvements using static styling methods. For more details, refer to the [Why Canvas Kit Styling](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-why-canvas-styling--docs) section.

## Core Styling Approaches for Static Styling

### `cs` Prop

The `cs` prop takes in a single, or an array of values that are created by the `cs` function, a
string representing a CSS class name, or the return of the `createVars` function. It merges
everything together and applies `className` and `style` attributes to a React element. Most of our components extend the `cs` prop so that you can statically apply styles to them.

>**Important**: While the `cs` prop accepts a style object, **this will not** be considered statically styling an element and you will lose the performance benefits.

```tsx
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-webs'
import {PrimaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button'

const styles = createStyles({ color: system.color.static.red.default });

function MyComponent() {
  return <PrimaryButton cs={styles}>Text</PrimaryButton>;
}
```

### `createStyles`

The primary utility function is the `createStyles` function. It makes a call to the `css` function
from `@emotion/css`. Emotion still does most of the heavy lifting by handling the serialization,
hashing, caching, and style injection.

#### Usage Example

```tsx
// Bad example (inside render function)
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-webs'
import {PrimaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button'

function MyComponent() {
  const styles = createStyles({ color: system.color.static.red.default }); // Don't do this
  return <PrimaryButton cs={styles}>Text</PrimaryButton>;
}

// Good example (outside render function)
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-webs'
import {PrimaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button'

const styles = createStyles({ color: system.color.static.red.default });

function MyComponent() {
  return <PrimaryButton cs={styles}>Text</PrimaryButton>;
}
```

> **Note:** Most of our components support using the `cs` prop to apply the static styles. It merges
everything together and applies `className` and `style` attributes to a React element.

#### Performance Benefits

`createStyles` is performant because:
- Styles are statically evaluated when styles are defined outside the render function
- No new StyleSheets are injected during render
- It works well with the browser's selector cache

#### When to Use `createStyles`
`createStyles` is a great way to generate static styles when styling our components that don't rely on dynamic styles. Use `createStyles` if you want to create re useable styles or need to apply simple style overrides to our components.

### `createStencil`
`createStencil` is a function for creating reusable, complex component styling systems. It manages `base` styles, `parts`, `modifiers`, `variables`, and `compound` modifiers. Most of our components also export their own Stencil that might expose CSS variables in order to modify the component.


#### Usage Example

In the example below, we leverage `parts`, `vars`, `base` and `modifiers` to create a reusable `Card` component. The Stencil allows us to dynamic style the component based on the props.

```tsx
import {createStencil}from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {Card} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/card';
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-webs';

const themedCardStencil = createStencil({
  vars: {
   // Create CSS variables for the color of the header
    headerColor: ''
  },
  parts: {
   // Allows for styling a sub element of the component that may not be exposed through the API
    header: 'themed-card-header'
  }
  base: ({headerPart, headerColor}) => ({
    padding: system.space.x4,
    boxShadow: system.depth[2],
    backgroundColor: system.color.bg.default,
    color: system.color.text.default,
    // Targets the header part via [data-part="themed-card-header"]"]
    [headerPart]: {
      color: headerColor
    }
  }),
  modifiers: {
    isDarkTheme: {
    // If the prop `isDarkTheme` is true, style the component and it's parts
      true: ({headerPart}) => ({
        backgroundColor: system.color.bg.contrast.default,
        color: system.color.text.inverse
        [headerPart]: {
          color: system.color.text.inverse
        }
      })
    }
  }
})

const ThemedCard = ({isDarkTheme, headerColor, elemProps}) => {
  return (
    /* Use the `cs` prop to apply the stencil and pass it the dynamic properties it needs to style accordingly */
    <Card cs={themedCardStencil({isDarkTheme, headerColor})} {...elemProps}>
	/* Apply the data part selector to the header */
      <Card.Heading {...themedCardStencil.parts.header}>Canvas Supreme</Card.Heading>
      <Card.Body>
        Our house special supreme pizza includes pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms,
        onions, and oregano.
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

#### When to Use `createStencil`
You should use `createStencil` when styling our components that have complex styles and dynamic properties. For a more in depth overview, please view our [Stencil](/docs/styling-stencils--docs) docs.


### Using `Base`

`Base` is a low level component that exposes the `cs` prop so that you can quickly apply styles to any element in a static way. If our components don't quite fit your styling needs, you can use `Base` to build a fully styled component.

#### Usage Example
```tsx
import {Base} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';
import {createStyles} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button';
import {system} from '@workday/canvas-tokens-web';

const containerStyles = createStyles({
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  gap: system.space.x2,
  padding: system.space.x6,
  alignItems: 'end'
})

const NavContainer = () => {
 return (
  <Base as='section' cs={containerStyles}>
    <PrimaryButton>Accept</PrimaryButton>
    <SecondaryButton>Cancel</SecondaryButton>
  </Base>
 )
}
```

#### When to Use `Base`
You should use `Base` when you want to statically style an element that Canvas Kit may not support, like a container, or wrapping element. By exposing the `cs` prop it allows for quick styling and correct style merging. For more information, view our `Base` component [docs](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/hooks-and-utilities-common--docs#base).
