## Styling Elements via Data Part

When building compound components, it's common that a sub component might render multiple elements that may not be exposed to the compound component API. In the example below, `MyComponent
`renders a body element, but only the parent div gets the styles applied and `elemProps` spread to it. In order to style the body element, you'd have to know the dom structure to target that specific element in order to style it.
```tsx
import {createStencil} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';

const myComponentStencil = createStencil({
  base: {
	background: 'transparent',
  }
});
const MyComponent = ({elemProps}) => {
  return (
	<div {...myComponentStencil() } {...elemProps}>
	  <div className="my-component__body" />
	</div>
  );
};
```

## Using `data-part` to Style Elements

In order to style elements that are not exposed in the API, we can use the `data-part` attribute. This allows us to target specific elements in the component without having to know the dom structure. In the example below, we can use the `data-part` attribute to style the body element.

```tsx
import {createStencil} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {createStencil} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';

const myComponentStencil = createStencil({
  parts: {
	body: 'my-component-body-element',
  }
  base: ({bodyPart}) => ({
	background: 'transparent',
	// this selector becomes `& ([data-part="my-component-body-element"])`
	// which will target the body element
	// and apply the styles to it
	`& (${bodyPart})`: {
	  background: 'red',
	},
  });
});
const MyComponent = ({elemProps}) => {
  return (
	<div {...myComponentStencil() } {...elemProps}>
	  {/* The data-part attribute is added to the element and we can use a type safe way to target the element */}
	  <div data-part={myComponentStencil.parts.body} className="my-component__body" />
	</div>
  );
};
```

As a reusable component, you can use the `data-part` attribute to style elements that are not exposed in the API. Consumers can also use the type safe stencil to target that element to style it as well.

>**Note:** While the `data-part` is a way to give access to elements in order to style, it should be used sparingly. The goal is to clean up the multiple uses of stencil within a file while giving consumers a type safe way to access elements that need styling.
