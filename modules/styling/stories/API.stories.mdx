## Usage

<SymbolDoc name="createStyles" />

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CreateStyles} />

In this example, the HTML will look like:

```html
<div class="css-m39zwu"></div>
```

The CSS will look like this:

```css
.css-m39zwu {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: gray;
}
```

We're using `className` for simplicity here. Most components will use the `cs` prop instead for more
versatility.

<SymbolDoc name="createVars" />

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CreateVars} />

In this example, the HTML will look like:

```html
<div class="css-4iptxs" style="--c6kna-background: gray;"></div>
<div class="css-4iptxs" style="--c6kna-background: blue;"></div>
```

And the CSS will look like:

```css
.css-4iptxs {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: var(--c6kna-background);
}
```

## Styling Precedence

In v9, we used `@emotion/styled` or `@emotion/react` for all styling which is a runtime styling
solution. Starting in v10, we're migrating our styling to a more static solution using
`createStyles` and the `cs` prop.

For a transition period, we're opting for backwards compatibility. If style props are present,
[styled components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) are used, or the
[css prop](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop) is used in a component, Emotion's style merging will be
invoked to make sure the following style precedence:

```
createStyles > CSS Prop > Styled Component > Style props
```

This will mean that any `css` prop or use of `styled` within the component tree _per element_ will
cause style class merging. For example:

```tsx
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import {createStyles} from '@workday/canvas-kit-styling';
import {mergeStyles} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/layout';

const styles1 = createStyles({
  padding: 4,
});

const styles2 = createStyles({
  padding: 12,
});

const Component1 = props => {
  return <div {...mergeStyles(props, [styles1])} />;
};

const Component2 = props => {
  return <Component1 cs={styles2} />;
};

const Component3 = styled(Component1)({
  padding: 8,
});

const Component4 = props => {
  return <Component3 cs={styles2} />;
};

export default () => (
  <>
    <Component1 />
    <Component2 />
    <Component3 />
    <Component4 />
  </>
);
```

The `styled` component API is forcing `mergeStyles` to go into Emotion merge mode, which removes the
`style1` class name and creates a new class based on all the merged style properties. So
`.component3` is a new class created by Emotion at render time that merges `.style1` and
`{padding: 8px}`. `Component4` renders `Component3` with a `cs` prop, but `Component3` is already in
merge mode and so `Component4` will also merge all styles into a new class name of `.component4`
that has the styles from `.style1`, `.component3`, and `{padding: 12px}`:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    .styles1 {
      padding: 4px;
    }
    .styles2 {
      padding: 8px;
    }
    .component3 {
      padding: 4px;
      padding: 8px;
    }
    .component4 {
      padding: 4px;
      padding: 8px;
      padding: 12px;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<div class="styles1"></div>
<div class="styles1 styles2"></div>
<div class="component3"></div>
<div class="component4"></div>
```

The `css` prop and `styled` component APIs will rewrite the `className` React prop by iterating over
all class names and seeing if any exist within the cache. If a class name does exist in the cache,
the CSS properties are copied to a new style property map until all the class names are evaluated
and removed from the `className` prop. Emotion will then combine all the CSS properties and inject a
new `StyleSheet` with a new class name and add that class name to the element.

The following example shows this style merging.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={StylingOverrides} />

## Performance

`createStyles` is more performant than `styled` components or the `css` prop because the styles must
be statically evaluated. The actual characters of a CSS property value cannot change at runtime.
This means we do not need to recalculate a hash every render or inject new `StyleSheet` entries into
the `StyleSheetList` in a render cycle. Injecting new `StyleSheets` causes slow
[Style Recalculation](https://web.dev/articles/reduce-the-scope-and-complexity-of-style-calculations).
What is not well known is browser engines maintain an internal selector cache to make style
recalculations as fast as possible. Adding a CSS class to a DOM element will invoke a style
recalculation, but if the the CSS selector is already in the `StyleSheetList`, the browser can
optimize how those styles are applied to the current element.

In the runtime Emotion's case, a novel style will result in a new style hash which results in a new
`StyleSheet` being injected into the `StyleSheetList`. To be safe, the browser's runtime engine will
throw away any style recalculation cache and start from scratch. This happens if you render a new
component on the page that hasn't been rendered yet, or if you make one of your style properties
dynamic between render cycles. Eventually the Emotion cache gets warm and style recalcuation costs
start to normalize and no longer invalidate the browser's selector cache.

On a page with over 1,000 elements and over 1,000
[CSSRules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSRule), (typical of a large web
application), the difference between a &lt; 1ms for warmed selector cache and &gt; 100ms for a fresh
selector cache. `createStyles` encourages a pattern similar to [BEM](https://getbem.com/) which
works well with the browser's selector cache by not injecting new `StyleSheet`s during a page's
normal operations. All styles are injected before any rendering takes place.
