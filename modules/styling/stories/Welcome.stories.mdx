# Canvas Styling

This package contains everything needed to create CSS styling. This styling package contains a
runtime for development and a static parsing process for build time.

Here are the goals for this project:

- TypeScript autocomplete of CSS object properties
- Low runtime for development
- Static CSS compilation for faster user experience
- Static CSS extraction for CSS only packages
- Dynamic styles using CSS Variables

If you're using Canvas Kit and not directly using this package, there is nothing extra to do on your
end. The Canvas Kit packages are using the static compilation as part of the build process. If you
want to use this package for your own styles, you don't need to do anything special to use in
development. Included is a small runtime to get styling working. If you wish to statically compile
your CSS from your TypeScript files for faster page loading, visit the
