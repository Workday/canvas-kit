# Canvas Styling

This package contains everything needed to create CSS styling. This styling package contains a
runtime for development and a static parsing process for build time.

Here are the goals for this project:

- TypeScript autocomplete of CSS object properties
- Low runtime for development
- Static CSS compilation for faster user experience
- Static CSS extraction for CSS only packages
- Dynamic styles using CSS Variables

If you're using Canvas Kit and not directly using this package, there is nothing extra to do on your
end. The Canvas Kit packages are using the static compilation as part of the build process. If you
want to use this package for your own styles, you don't need to do anything special to use in
development. Included is a small runtime to get styling working. If you wish to statically compile
your CSS from your TypeScript files for faster page loading, visit the
[Getting Started](/docs/features-styling-getting-started--page)

## What is this?

Canvas Kit Styling is two things:

1. A utility function wrapper around `@emotion/css`
2. An optional static compiler to get remove most of the runtime

### Utility functions

The basic utility function is the `cs` function. It makes a call to the `css` function from
`@emotion/css`. Emotion takes care of the serializing, hashing, caching, and style injection.
`@emotion/css` does most of the heavy lifting.

These utility functions make it easier to create styles for element-based components with CSS
Variables used for dynamic properties and modifiers used for dynamic groups of properties. The API
functions can be found in the [API docs](/docs/features-styling-api--create-styles)

### Static compiler

The static compiler run as a TypeScript transform during TypeScript's transpilation phase. It
requires the TypeScript type checker to determine the static value of any variables used. The
transformer calls `@emotion/serialize` to pre-compute the serialized styles and hash so that the
`@emotion/css` can skip these steps. For example, there's the before/after of the code.

```ts
// before
const myVars = createVars('textColor', 'backgroundColor');

const myStyles = createStyles({
  fontSize: 12,
  color: cssVar(myVars.textColor),
  backgroundColor: cssVar(myVars.backgroundColor),
});

// after
const myVars = createVars('textColor', 'backgroundColor');

const myStyles = createStyles({
  name: 'a8g234',
  styles:
    'font-size: 12px; color: var(--css-my-vars-textColor); backgroundColor: var(--css-my-vars-backgroundColor);',
});
```

Emotion has an internal shortcut that recognizes the `styles` property and
[short circuits interpolation](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/blob/f3b268f7c52103979402da919c9c0dd3f9e0e189/packages/serialize/src/index.js#L319).
