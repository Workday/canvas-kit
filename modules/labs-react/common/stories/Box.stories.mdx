# Box

[![LABS: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/LABS-beta-orange)](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/labs-react/README.md)
This component is work in progress and currently in pre-release.

`Box` is a primitive component that provides a common, ergonomic API around Canvas design tokens. It
is highly flexible, and its primary purpose is to build other components.

## Style Props

While `Box` supports `as`, `ref`, and all semantic element props, style props are at its heart.
Style props are special design-system-aware props that allow you to use Canvas design tokens
efficiently as you build components. Style props are better understood by their categories, which
are listed below. Each category has a more detailed explanation in the following subsections.

### Categories

- [Depth](#depth)

### Depth

Depth style props allow you to adjust the visual elevation of a component using our depth tokens.
`Box` applies these tokens via the `depth` prop.
