# Box

[![LABS: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/LABS-beta-orange)](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/labs-react/README.md)
This component is work in progress and currently in pre-release.

`Box` is a primitive component that provides a common, ergonomic API around Canvas design tokens. It
is highly flexible, and its primary purpose is to build other components.

## Style Props

While `Box` supports `as`, `ref`, and all semantic element props, style props are at its heart.
Style props are special design-system-aware props that allow you to use Canvas design tokens
efficiently as you build components. Style props are better understood by their categories, which
are listed below. Each category has a more detailed explanation in the following subsections.

### Categories

- [Color](#color)
- [Depth](#depth)
- [Layout](#layout)
- [Position](#position)

### Color

Color style props allow you to adjust the color and background color of components. There are three
color props available: `color`, `backgroundColor`, and `bgColor` (an alias for `backgroundColor`).

#### Example

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Color} />

### Depth

Depth style props allow you to adjust the visual elevation of a component using our depth tokens.
`Box` applies these tokens via the `depth` prop.

#### Example

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Depth} />

### Layout

Layout style props allow you to adjust the display, dimensions, and overflow of a component. These
props are not connected to our design tokens, but they are often useful for building components.

#### Example

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Layout} />

### Position

Position style props allow you to adjust the position of a component. These props are not connected
to our design tokens, but they are often useful for building components.

#### Example

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Position} />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Box} />
