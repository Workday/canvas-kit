# Canvas Kit ColorPicker

ColorPicker is a
[compound component](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/compound-components/) that contains
sub components like a swatchbook, input, and swatch. This component is built on top of the
[list and grid system](/docs/welcome-dev-docs-collections--basic-grid).

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-labs-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

In a basic example of color picker, given an array of colors it will render a swatchbook. The model
exposes the current color selected. This component is built off of a grid system, therefore, you can
use arrow keys to navigate through the swatchbook to select a color.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### With Color Input

As part of the subcomponents you can render a color input. When wrapped in the form, all basic form
behaviors works. The color input allows you to set a custom color.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithColorInput} />

### With Column Count

You can set a custom column count on the model. Because this component uses the grid system,
keyboard navigation wraps your selection.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithCustomColumnCount} />

### With Initial Color

You set an intial color selected by passing an initial color to the model.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithInitialColor} />

### With Popup

You can render the color picker within a popup.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithPopup} />
