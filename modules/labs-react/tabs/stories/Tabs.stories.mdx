This component is work in progress and currently in pre-release.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-labs-react
```

## Usage

This component follows the
[W3 Tabs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#tabpanel). `Tabs` is a
[Compound Component](../../../../modules/docs/mdx/COMPOUND_COMPONENTS.mdx), which means it can be
composed in a variety of different ways. We'll first cover some basic usage examples followed by
more advanced usage.

### Basic Usage

Below are examples we expect will work for most cases. Please refer to the
[Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) section for details on supporting custom implementations.

#### Basic Example

In this example, a few tab items and tab panels are set up without any named keys.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Simple} />

#### Named Keys

`Tabs.Item` and `Tabs.Panel` both take an optional `name` attribute that are used for the
`onActivate` callback. This example is the same, but with named keys for the tabs and panels.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={NamedKeys} />

#### Right-to-Left

`Tabs` supports right-to-left through the theme of the `CanvasProvider`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RightToLeft} />

#### Disabled Tab

A `Tab.Item` can be disabled by passing `disabled={true}`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={DisabledTab} />

#### Alternative Tab Stop

By default, tab panels are focusable for accessibility. If the contents of a tab panel have a
focusable element, you may disable this default behavior by setting `tabIndex` to `undefined`. This
example has a tab panel with a focusable button in the tab panel.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={AlternativeTabStop} />

### Advanced Usage

Below are some examples for more advanced / custom use cases. We expect most people won't need to
read this section, but if you're needing to go beyond basic examples or are curious, feel free to
explore this section. While these examples are not exhaustive, they provide additional insight into
what's possible.

#### Hoisted Model

The `Tabs` component takes in an optional `model` property. If not defined, it will create and use
its own. Hoisting the model allows access to state and events outside the `Tabs` component family.
You can create a `TabsModel` using the `useTabsModel` hook and configure the model with the same
configuration that the `Tabs` component receives. If you pass in a configured model, configuration
properties passed to the `Tabs` component will be ignored.

In this example, we'll set up external observation of the `TabsModel` state and set up an external
button to trigger an event to change the currently active tab.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={HoistedModel} />

#### Single Tab Panel

The compound component patterns allows advanced composition. For example, the tabs can be composed
to have only a single tab panel using attribute overrides and callbacks. More info about attributes
and callbacks are in property tables below for each sub-component. In this example, we'll use a
Hoisted model and the `activeTab` property of the state to show content of our `contents` object.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={SinglePanel} />

#### Dynamic Tabs

The `Tabs.Item` component takes in an optional `index` property if you want to specify the position
of a tab. If not defined, by default it will append tabs to the end. For example, if your tabs are
stored as an array in the state that can be added to along with a fixed tab that should remain at
the end.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={DynamicTabs} />

## Components

### Tabs

The `Tabs` component is the container component that is responsible for creating a `TabsModel` that
is shared using React context. It does not represent a real element.

#### Usage

```tsx
// configuration
<Tabs onActivate={({ data }) => console.log('Activate tab', data.tab)}>
  {/* sub components go here */ }
</Tabs>

// OR

// model
const model = useTabsModel(config)

<Tabs model={model}>
  {/* sub components go here */ }
</Tabs>
```

#### Component Props

<PropsTable of={Tabs} />

---

### Tabs.List

`Tabs.List` is a `div` element with a `role=tablist`. It is a container for `Tabs.Item` components.
Any additional attributes provided will be forwared to the dom element.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Tabs.List>{/* Tabs.Items go here */}</Tabs.List>
```

#### Component Props

<PropsTable of={Tabs.List} />

---

### Tabs.Item

`Tabs.Item` is a `button` element with a `role=tab`. Each `Tabs.Item` is associated with a
`Tabs.Panel` either by a `name` attribute or by the position in the list. If a `name` is provided,
it must match the name passed to the `Tabs.Panel` component.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Tabs.Item name="first">First Tab</Tabs.Item>
```

#### Component Props

<PropsTable of={Tabs.Item} />

---

### Tabs.Panel

`Tabs.Panel` is a `div` element with a `role=tabpanel`. It is focusable by default. Each
`Tabs.Panel` is controlled by a `Tabs.Item` either by a `name` attribute or by the position in the
list. If a `name` is provided, it must match the name passed to the `Tabs.Item` component.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Tabs.Panel name="first">{/* contents of the tab panel */}</Tabs.Panel>
```

#### Component Props

<PropsTable of={Tabs.Panel} />
