## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-labs-react
```

## Usage

`Pagination` is a compound component, meaning it can be put together and used in a variety of
different ways. We'll first cover [basic usage](#basic-usage) examples followed by
[advanced usage](#advanced-usage). Each of the examples is intended to be standalone, so you can
skip to the section that best fits your use case.

These examples are designed to provide copy-and-paste snippets to help you get up and running
quickly without much explanation. Further detail on individual component props, behavior, and
accessibility can be found in the [Components](#components) section.

---

### Basic Usage

Below are examples we expect will work for most use cases. Please refer to the
[Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) section for details on supporting custom implementations.

#### Step Controls

In this example, the component uses step controls (`Pagination.StepToPreviousButton` and
`Pagination.StepToNextButton`) that allow you to move to the next page and previous pages.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={StepControls} />

---

#### Jump Controls

This example adds jump controls (`Pagination.JumpToFirstButton` and `Pagination.JumpToLastButton`)
that allow you to skip to the first and last items in the range.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={JumpControls} />

---

#### GoTo Form

This example adds a form (`Pagination.GoToForm`) that allows you to skip to a specific page within
the range.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={GoToForm} />

---

#### Additional Details

This example adds a visible section (`Pagination.AdditionalDetails`). It is an `aria-live` region
that announces the current page update to screen readers. Because of that, it's important to
**always‚Ä†** include it in your `Pagination` component.

In the case where you would also have multiple `Pagination` components sharing the same state and
you'd like to keep the `AdditionalDetails` component on multiple, you will need to set
`shouldAnnounceToScreenReader` to `false` on all but one component to prevent announcement.

> **‚Ä†** _The only exception to this rule is when you have multiple `Pagination` components that are
> sharing the same state and rendered on the page. You can then safely remove all but one of the
> `AdditionalDetails` sections. This will prevent a screenreader from announcing updates multiple
> times to a user._

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ShowAdditionalDetails} />

---

#### RTL (Right-to-Left)

This example shows how the component supports right-to-left languages.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTL} />

---

#### Custom Range

This example uses a custom range that allows you to control the width of the component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CustomRange} />

---

### Advanced Usage

Below are examples for more advanced / custom usage of these components. We expect most people won't
need to read this section, but if you're needing to go beyond our basic examples or just curious,
feel free to explore this section. While this section is not exhaustive, it provides additional
insight into what's possible.

#### Hoisted Model Pattern

If you're unfamiliar with compound components, the pagination model, or the `usePaginationModel`
hook, we would recommend reviewing the [PaginationModel](#paginationmodel) section first.

If you want the `Pagination` component to handle its state and events internally and hook into page
change events, the basic usage examples above should be sufficient. However, if you need external
access to the model, you can use the hoisted model pattern. You can create a model outside of the
component with the `usePaginationModel` hook.

For this example, we'll create a `Pagination` component that handles 128 total items with 10 items
per page.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={HoistedModel} />

## Components

### Pagination

The `Pagination` component is a wrapper for a React context provider and `nav` element. Child
components such as `Pagination.StepToPreviousButton`, `Pagination.PageList`, etc. subscribe to that
context.

#### Usage

`Pagination` can be used with or without providing a model. For basic usage, you only need to
provide a configuration as in the example below.

```tsx
<Pagination
  aria-label="Pagination"
  lastPage={100}
  initialCurrentPage={6}
  rangeSize={3}
  onPageChange={pageNumber => console.log(pageNumber)}
>
  {/* child components go here */}
</Pagination>
```

However, if you'd like to provide a model, you can follow the example below. This is called the
hoisted model pattern. Note that in this pattern, the only props needed are `model` and
`aria-label`.

```tsx
const modelConfig = {
  lastPage: 100,
  initialCurrentPage: 6,
  rangeSize: 3,
  onPageChange: pageNumber => console.log(pageNumber),
};
const model = usePaginationModel(modelConfig);

return (
  <Pagination aria-label="Pagination" model={model}>
    {/* child components go here */}
  </Pagination>
);
```

#### Component Props

Given that there are two ways to configure `Pagination`, there are also two props tables. For the
configuration pattern, follow this table:

| name               | type                           | required?  | default | recommended                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| aria-label         | `string`                       | ‚úÖ `true`  | n/a     | "Pagination" (and translated equivalent) |
| lastPage           | `number`                       | ‚úÖ `true`  | n/a     | n/a                                      |
| initialCurrentPage | `number`                       | üö´ `false` | 1       | n/a                                      |
| rangeSize          | `number`                       | üö´ `false` | 5       | n/a                                      |
| firstPage          | `number`                       | üö´ `false` | 1       | n/a                                      |
| onPageChange       | `(pageNumber: number) => void` | üö´ `false` | n/a     | n/a                                      |

And for the hoisted model pattern, follow this table:

| name       | type              | required? | default | recommended                              |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| aria-label | `string`          | ‚úÖ `true` | n/a     | "Pagination" (and translated equivalent) |
| model      | `PaginationModel` | ‚úÖ `true` | n/a     | n/a                                      |

This component also supports
[all native HTMLElement props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).
The `aria-label` prop is required for accessibility. We recommend using `"Pagination"` as seen in
the example.

---

### Pagination.Controls

`Pagination.Controls` is a styled `div` wrapper that provides proper alignment and spacing between
elements inside `Pagination`. It does not handle any internal business logic or state.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Pagination.Controls>{/* child components go here */}</Pagination.Controls>
```

#### Component Props

This component supports
[all native HTMLDivElement props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div#Attributes).

---

### Pagination.JumpToFirstButton

`Pagination.JumpToFirstButton` is an `IconButton` that subscribes to `Pagination`'s context. This
allows it to know when to disable and set `currentPage` to the first page.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Pagination.JumpToFirstButton aria-label="First" />
```

#### Component Props

| name       | type     | required? | default | recommended                         |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| aria-label | `string` | ‚úÖ `true` | n/a     | "First" (and translated equivalent) |

This component also supports all `IconButton` props.

---

### Pagination.StepToPreviousButton

`Pagination.StepToPreviousButton` is an `IconButton` that subscribes to `Pagination`'s context. This
allows it to know when to disable and decrement the `currentPage`.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Pagination.StepToPreviousButton aria-label="Previous" />
```

#### Component Props

| name       | type     | required? | default | recommended                            |

<Pagination.StepToNextButton aria-label="Next" />
```

#### Component Props

| name       | type     | required? | default | recommended                        |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| aria-label | `string` | ‚úÖ `true` | n/a     | "Next" (and translated equivalent) |

This component also supports all `IconButton` props.

---

### Pagination.JumpToLastButton

| aria-label | `string` | ‚úÖ `true` | n/a     | "Last" (and translated equivalent) |

This component also supports all `IconButton` props.

---

### Pagination.PageList

`Pagination.PageList` is an ordered list (`ol`) that subscribes to `Pagination`'s context. This
allows it generate the `range` of page numbers. It also handles spacing between the child elements.
This component will accept either child elements or functional children (sometimes called the render
prop pattern). It's likely you'll want to use the functional children, but in the off-chance you
need a static list of items, this component will support it. The usage section below will provide
examples of both.

#### Usage

The functional children snippet below will likely be the most common use case.

```tsx
<Pagination.PageList>
  {({state}) =>
    state.range.map(pageNumber => (
      <Pagination.PageListItem key={pageNumber}>
        <Pagination.PageButton aria-label={`Page ${pageNumber}`} pageNumber={pageNumber} />
      </Pagination.PageListItem>
    ))
  }
</Pagination.PageList>
```

#### Component Props

| name     | type                                                             | required?  | default | recommended |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| children | (model: PaginationModel) => React.ReactNode[] \| React.ReactNode | üö´ `false` | n/a     | n/a         |

This component also supports
[all native HTMLOLElement props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol#Attributes).

---

### Pagination.PageListItem

`Pagination.PageListItem` is a styled `li` element. It provides a child semantic element for the
`PageList` component and is important for accessibility. It does not handle any internal business
logic or state.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Pagination.PageListItem>{/* child element goes here */}</Pagination.PageListItem>
```

#### Component Props

This component also supports
[all native HTMLLIElement props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#Attributes).

---

### Pagination.PageButton

`Pagination.PageButton` is an `IconButton` that subscribes to `Pagination`'s context. This allows it
to know set the `toggled` styling when it is the current item and update the `currentPage`.

#### Usage

`PageButton` will render the `pageNumber` as its children.

```tsx
<Pagination.PageButton aria-label="Page 2" pageNumber={2} />
```

#### Component Props

| name       | type     | required? | default | recommended                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| aria-label | `string` | ‚úÖ `true` | n/a     | `Page ${pageNumber}` (and translated equivalent) |
| pageNumber | `number` | ‚úÖ `true` | n/a     | n/a                                              |

This component also supports all `IconButton` props.

---

### Pagination.GoToForm

`Pagination.GoToForm` is a wrapper for a React context provider and `form` element. Child components
such as `Pagination.GoToTextInput` and `Pagination.GoToLabel` subscribe to that context to manage
the form state and behavior as well as update the `currentPage` in the `Pagination` component.

#### Usage

```tsx
<Pagination.GoToForm>{/* child elements go here */}</Pagination.GoToForm>
```

#### Component Props

This component supports
[all native HTMLFormElement props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#Attributes).

---

### Pagination.GoToTextInput

#### Usage

```tsx
<Pagination.GoToTextInput aria-label="Go to page number" />
```

#### Component Props

| name       | type     | required? | default | recommended                                     |
| ---------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| aria-label | `string` | ‚úÖ `true` | n/a     | `Go to page number` (and translated equivalent) |

This component also supports all `TextInput` props.

---

### Pagination.GoToLabel

`Pagination.GoToLabel` is a styled `label` element that subscribes to the `Pagination` context. This
allows it to pass the `Pagination` context to child elements.

#### Usage

This component will accept either child elements or functional children (sometimes called the render
prop pattern). It's likely you'll want to use the functional children, but in the off-chance you
need static child elements, this component will support it. Examples of both patterns are provided
below.

**Functional Children**

Use this pattern when you need access to the state in the `Pagination` context for your text.

```tsx
<Pagination.GoToLabel>{({state}) => `of ${state.lastPage} results`}</Pagination.GoToLabel>
```

#### Component Props

| name     | type                                                           | required?  | default | recommended |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| htmlFor  | `string`                                                       | üö´ `false` | n/a     | n/a         |
| children | (model: PaginationModel) => React.ReactNode \| React.ReactNode | üö´ `false` | n/a     | n/a         |

This component also supports
[all native HTMLLabelElement props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label#Attributes).

---

### Pagination.AdditionalDetails

`Pagination.AdditionalDetails` is a styled `div` container that subscribes to the `Pagination`
context. This allows it to pass the `Pagination` context to child elements. It is also an
`aria-live` region that announces the current page update to screen readers. Because of that, it's
important to always\* include it in your `Pagination` component.

_\* The only exception to this rule is when you have multiple `Pagination` components that are
sharing the same state and rendered on the page. You can then safely remove all but one of the
`AdditionalDetails` sections. This will prevent a screenreader from announcing updates multiple
times to a user._

In the case where you would also have multiple `Pagination` components sharing the same state and
you'd like to keep the `AdditionalDetails` component on multiple, you will need to set
`shouldAnnounceToScreenReader` to `false` on all but one component to prevent announcement.

#### Usage

This component will accept either child elements or functional children (sometimes called the render
prop pattern). It's likely you'll want to use the functional children, but in the off-chance you
need static child elements, this component will support it.

```tsx
<Pagination.AdditionalDetails>
  {({state}) =>
    `${getVisibleResultsMin(state.currentPage, resultCount)}-${getVisibleResultsMax(
      state.currentPage,
      resultCount,
      totalCount
    )} of ${totalCount} results`
  }
</Pagination.AdditionalDetails>
```

#### Component Props

| name                         | type                                                           | required?  | default | recommended |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| shouldHideDetails            | `boolean`                                                      | üö´ `false` | false   | n/a         |
| shouldAnnounceToScreenReader | `boolean`                                                      | üö´ `false` | true    | n/a         |
| children                     | (model: PaginationModel) => React.ReactNode \| React.ReactNode | ‚úÖ `true`  | n/a     | n/a         |

## Models, Hooks, & Utils

### PaginationModel

> **Note:** The model and compound component pattern presented here will be updated and solidified
> in v5 of canvas-kit. While the general concepts are the same, there will be some breaking changes
> in v5. If you'd like to learn about models and compound components in v5, please refer to
> [this doc](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/blob/master/COMPOUND_COMPONENTS.md).

The `PaginationModel` is the core of the `Pagination` component. That said, if you're using the
higher-level context API components and following the basic usage guidelines, you shouldn't need to
know how the model operates to successfully implement the component. But if you have an advanced use
case or you're feeling curious, this section is for you.

If `Pagination` was stripped of all its markup, attributes, and styling, what would remain is the
model. The `PaginationModel` is how we describe the state and behavior of the component. You could
completely swap out the underlying elements, attributes, and styles, and the model would remain the
same. `PaginationModel` is an object that is composed of two parts: `state` and `events`. The
model's `state` describes the current state of the component, and `events` are functions that act on
that state (also called behaviors). Below is an example `Pagination` model:

```tsx
const paginationModel = {
  state: {
    firstPage,
    currentPage,
    lastPage,
    range,
    rangeSize,
  },
  events: {
    first,
    last,
    next,
    previous,
    setCurrentPage,
    goTo,
  };
};

```

#### State

The `state` describes the current state of the `Pagination` component. As events are fired, the
state is updated, and the component will re-render. Below are the `state` keys and descriptions of
their values:

- `firstPage` - the page number for the first page
- `currentPage` - the page number for the current page
- `lastPage` - the page number for the last page (it can also be used as a total page count)
- `range` - an array of page numbers included in the pagination range
- `rangeSize` - the size of the pagination range

#### Events

The model's `events` describe behaviors that act on `state`. Below are the `events` keys and
descriptions of their values:

- `first` - sets the current page to the first page
- `last` - sets the current page to the last page
- `next` - increments the current page by 1
- `previous` - decrements the current page by 1
- `goTo` - sets the current page to a given page number\* (with safeguards)
- `setCurrentPage` - sets the current page to a given page number (no safeguards)

\* _`goTo` is very similar to `setCurrentPage`, but it has some built-in safeguards. If the page
number provided is below the first page (e.g: `0`), `currentPage` will be set to the `firstPage`.
Similarly, if the number provided is larger than the `lastPage`, it will set `currentPage` to the
`lastPage`._

---

### usePaginationModel Hook

The `Pagination` model can be created with the `usePaginationModel` hook. Normally `Pagination` will
create it for you under the hood with the configuration props you provide the component, but you can
also hoist the model outside of the component depending on your use case.

#### Configuration

The hook configuration is identical to the `Pagination` component configuration. The only value you
need to provide is `lastPage`, but you can also provide others. The full list is below:

| name                | type                           | required   | default |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| lastPage            | `number`                       | ‚úÖ `true`  | n/a     |
| firstPage?          | `number`                       | üö´ `false` | 1       |
| initialCurrentPage? | `number`                       | üö´ `false` | n/a     |

#### Usage

Using this hook is fairly straightforward. Create a configuration, pass it to the hook, and it
returns a model.

```ts
const paginationConfig = {
  lastPage: 100,
  rangeSize: 3,
  onPageChange: pageNumber => console.log(pageNumber),
};

const model = usePaginationModel(paginationConfig);
```

Voil√†! Now you can pass the model to `Pagination` like so:

```tsx
const paginationConfig = {
  lastPage: 100,
  rangeSize: 3,
  onPageChange: pageNumber => console.log(pageNumber),
};

const model = usePaginationModel(paginationConfig);

return (
  <Pagination aria-label="Pagination" model={model}>
    {/* child components go here */}
  </Pagination>
);
```

If you're hoisting the model, it's presumably because you need more access to the model's `state`
and `events` outside of the component. You could have an external button trigger events to update
the state, or have another component use the model's state. See the
[Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) section for more detailed information.

### getLastPage

This function takes the number of results per page and the total count of results and returns the
last page number. Here's an example:

Given there are 10 results per page, and there are 128 total results, the function will return 13.

```ts
const resultCount = 10;
const totalCount = 128;
const lastPage = getLastPage(resultCount, totalCount); //=> 13
```

---

### getRangeMin

This function takes the pagination range and returns its minimum value. Here's an example:

Given the pagination range is 1-5, the function will return 1.

```ts
const range = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const rangeMin = getRangeMin(range); //=> 1
```

---

### getRangeMax

This function takes the pagination range and returns its maximum value. Here's an example:

Given the pagination range is 1-5, the function will return 5.

```ts
const range = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const rangeMin = getRangeMax(range); //=> 5
```

---

### getVisibleResultsMin

This function takes the current page, and number of results per page, and returns the minimum value
for that page. Here's an example:

Given there are 10 results per page, and the current page is 5, the function will return 41.

```ts
const currentPage = 5;
const resultCount = 10;
const pageMin = getVisibleResultsMin(currentPage, resultCount); //=> 41
```

---

### getVisibleResultsMax

This function takes the current page, number of results per page, and the total number of results,
and returns the maximum value for that page. Here's an example:

Given there are 10 results per page, the current page is 5, and there are 42 results total, the
function will return 42.

```ts
const currentPage = 5;
const resultCount = 10;
const totalCount = 42;
const pageMax = getVisibleResultsMax(currentPage, resultCount, totalCount); //=> 42
```

---

### PaginationContext

You can also subscribe directly to `PaginationContext`. This is useful if you want to create a new,
custom subcomponent for your implementation and want it to subscribe to `Pagination`'s context.
Here's a simple example:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {Pagination, PaginationContext} from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/pagination';

const CustomButton = (props: React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
  const model = React.useContext(PaginationContext);

  const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>) => {
    // if onClick is provided, pass the event along
    props.onClick?.(e);
    model.events.goTo(10);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick} {...props}>
      Go To Page 10
    </button>
  );
};

export const CustomPagination = () => {
  return (
    <Pagination aria-label="Pagination" lastPage={20}>
      <CustomButton aria-label="Page 10" />
      {/* other child components go here */}
    </Pagination>
  );
};
```
