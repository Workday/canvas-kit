# Flex

[![LABS: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/LABS-beta-orange)](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/labs-react/README.md)
This component is work in progress and currently in pre-release.

`Flex` is a low-level layout component that provides a common, ergonomic API for building
one-dimensional layouts with
[CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox).

## Up & Running

```tsx
import {Flex, FlexStyleProps} from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/layout';
```

## What's the difference between `Flex` and `Box`?

`Flex` is built with `Box` and has access to all `BoxProps`. The main differences between `Box` and
`Flex` are:

- `Flex` is set to `display: flex` by default
- The `display` prop is limited to `flex` and `inline-flex`
- `Flex` has access to flex container properties.

## Flex Props

While `Box` supports [flex item](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Item)
properties, `Flex` adds
[flex container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Container) properties. There
are seven flex props: `alignItems`, `alignContent`, `display`, `justifyItems`, `justifyContent`,
`flexWrap`, and `flexDirection`.

## Examples

Nesting `Flex` components can allow you to create rows and columns to build layouts.
