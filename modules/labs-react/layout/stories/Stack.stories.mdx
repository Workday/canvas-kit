# Stack, HStack, and VStack

[![LABS: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/LABS-beta-orange)](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/labs-react/README.md)
This component is work in progress and currently in pre-release.

`Stack`, `HStack`, and `VStack` are higher-level layout components that provide an ergonomic API for
building one-dimensional layouts with consistent spacing between elements. They're built on top of
`Flex` and have access to all `FlexProps` and `BoxProps`. `Stack` can align items in either a
horizontal or vertical orientation. `HStack` and `VStack` will only align items in a horizontal or
vertical orientation, respectively.

## Stack

`Stack` is a helpful component for creating layouts with equal spacing between elements. It can
create horizontal or vertical stacks of elements.

### Usage

```tsx
import {Stack, StackStyleProps} from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/layout';
```

### What Stack Is & Isn't

The most important distinction to make with `Stack` is that it is _not a grid._ Grid components are
able to align items along two dimensions (rows and columns), and `Stack` is only built to support
one dimension (rows _or_ columns). That said, you can nest horizontal and vertical `Stack`
components to create grid-like layouts.

### Setting Direction

The direction of the child elements is set with the `flexDirection` prop. This prop supports four
directions: `column`, `column-reverse`, `row`, and `row-reverse`. By default, it will set the
direction to `row` as is consistent with the CSS Flexbox spec.

### Setting Space

The space between child elements is set with the `spacing` prop, which supports all space token and
string values. `Stack` intentionally only sets space between elements and never outside. For
example: a vertical stack of three elements would only have margin added to the top of the second
and third child elements. Keeping space between elements makes building layouts more block-like and
predictable.

### Managing Child Elements

#### Basic Usage

`Stack` uses CSS pseudo-classes to apply margin to child elements. This makes it really simple to
add child elements and get consistent spacing without much manual effort. Below is a basic example.
Note that it does not add any space above or below the child elements. This helps your element fit
cleanly within their containers.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BasicStack} />

#### Using `shouldWrapChildren`

Because of the increased specificity of `Stack`'s pseduo-classes, it may override the child element
margin styles. In that case, there are two recommended options available: Use the
`shouldWrapChildren` prop or using `Stack.Item` (which is discussed in the section below). The
`shouldWrapChildren` prop will wrap each child in a `Stack.Item` component and apply the margin to
it instead of the child element. Below is an example with even space between the first three
elements, and custom space between the third and fourth elements.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ShouldWrapChildren} />

#### Using `Stack.Item`

Sometimes inserting wrapper elements can be problematic when you need access to those elements. In
those situations, `shouldWrapChildren` is not the best choice, and you should opt for wrapping
children in `Stack.Item`s. Below we're wrapping each of the three elements in the first row with
`Stack.Item` and applying `flex={1}` to them. This would not be possible with `shouldWrapChildren`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={StackItems} />

### Valid Children

Because `Stack` applies styles to children, it requires its immediate children to be valid child
elements. For example, text outside of an HTML tag would not render if it was an immediate `Stack`
child. Here's an example snippet:

```tsx
const ValidChildrenExample = () => {
  return (
    <Stack flexDirection="row" spacing="s">
      This text will not render. Don't do this.
      <p>This text will render.</p>
      <span>This text will also render.</span>
    </Stack>
  );
};
```

### Examples

You can nest vertical and horizontal `Stack`s to create grid-like layouts. Here are three horizontal
`Stack`s nested within a vertical `Stack`. The fourth row is a single `Flex` component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={NestedStacks} />

You can also use `Stack` to manage smaller layouts, such as within Cards.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={StackCard} />

## HStack

`HStack` works identically to `Stack` but is limited to only `row` and `row-reverse` directions. It
defaults to `row` if no `flexDirection` is provided.

### Usage

```tsx
import {HStack, HStackStyleProps} from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/layout';
```

### Example

In this example, `HStack` is placing three cards in a row with small spacing between them.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={HStackCards} />

## VStack

`VStack` works identically to `Stack` but is limited to only `column` and `column-reverse`
directions. It defaults to `column` if no `flexDirection` is provided.

### Usage

```tsx
import {VStack, VStackStyleProps} from '@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react/layout';
```

### Example

In this example, `VStack` is placing three cards in a column with small spacing between them.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={VStackCards} />
