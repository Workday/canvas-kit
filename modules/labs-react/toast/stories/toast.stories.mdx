# Canvas Kit Toast

[![LABS: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/LABS-alpha-orange)](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/labs-react/README.md)
This component is work in progress and currently in pre-release.

`Toast` is a Canvas-styled React toast component. It allows for a brief message to be be shown about
a process or action occurring in the app.

yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-labs-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

It is up to the consumer on how a Toast is triggered and it's contents. In a basic example, a Toast
should provide some information. By default, a Toast's `mode` is set to `polite` but this may vary
based on the contents of the Toast.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Success} />

#### WithCloseButton

A Toast and can also be dismissive with a `Toast.Close`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithCloseButton} />

---

#### Error

If a Toast is to convey something urgent such as an error, it's mode should be set to `assertive`.
This changes `aria-live` to `assertive` as well as `role` to be `alert`. Doing so provides a better
accessibility experience.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Error} />

---

#### With an Action Link

There are time where a Toast might have a follow up action. If a Toast has an action, it's `mode`
should be set to `interactive`. By doing so, the `role` of the Toast is set to `dialog` and an
`aria-label` is added to indicate that it's a notifcation of some kind.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={WithActionLink} />

#### Complete Example with Popper

The Toast on its own is a stylized `Card` component. However, when paired with `Popper` you can use
it to place it wherever you like on the page.
