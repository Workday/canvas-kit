# Canvas Kit Toast

[![LABS: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/LABS-alpha-orange)](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/tree/master/modules/labs-react/README.md)
This component is work in progress and currently in pre-release.

`Toast` is a Canvas-styled React toast component. It allows for a brief message to be be shown about
a process or action occurring in the app.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Below are examples we expect will work for most use cases. Note that all examples include icons as
they are an important signifier to communicate meaning. For this reason, Toast notifications should
always include an icon.
