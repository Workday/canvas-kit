# Canvas Kit Radio

Radio Buttons allow a user to select one value from a predefined list of 7 or fewer options.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/inputs/radio-buttons)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Radio Buttons are intended to be grouped together using a Radio Group.

Radio Group should be used in tandem with [Form Field](/components/inputs/form-field/) where the
`useFieldset` prop is set to `true` to meet accessibility standards.
