# Canvas Kit Side Panel

`SidePanel` is a collaspible container that anchors to the left or right side of the screen.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/containers/side-panel)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-labs-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`SidePanel` is composed of three parts:

- The panel container
- An accessible name (either on a visible element or hidden)
- A toggle button to control the expand / collapse states

Bidirectional support is built into `SidePanel`. As seen in the example below, CSS Flexbox flips the
page layout and the panel's contents. `SidePanel` also has logic to flip the position and direction
of the `ToggleButton` as well as the direction of the expand / collapse animation. If you're using
CSS Flexbox for layouts and using the provided components, you shouldn't have to provide any custom
logic or styling for bidirecitonal support.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Hidden Name

`SidePanel` must always have an accessible label for both the HTML `<section>` container and the
`ToggleButton`. The `labelProps` component must always be present in the DOM in order for the
`panelProps` and `controlProps` component labels to be assigned properly. A `hidden` attribute can
be applied to the `labelProps` component. In the example below, we are demonstrating the
`AccessibleHide` component that relies on CSS properties to visually hide text for screen readers
only.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={HiddenName} />

### Alternate Variant

`SidePanel` has one variant, `alternate`, which you can supply as a top-level prop. Default depth of
`alternate` variant is 5, if `alternate` SidePanel has an overlay behavior the depth 6 should be
used (this case is covered in the Examples section).

<ExampleCodeBlock code={AlternatePanel} />

### External Control

Sometimes you'll want to control `SidePanel`'s' expand / collapse behavior from outside the
component. In that case, you can use the `controlProps` supplied by the `useSidePanel` hook.

#### Notes about accessibility

The `controlProps` object delivers ARIA attributes to a component under the following assumptions:

1. The control is an icon button that does not already have an accessible name
2. The control appears at (or near) the top of the expandable content in the `SidePanel`

Spreading the `controlProps` onto an external control can introduce serious accessibility issues:

- `aria-labelledby` HTML `id` reference may become invalid when the SidePanel is collapsed, or when
  the `labelProps` component isn't present in the DOM.
- `aria-labelledby` will change the name of `controlProps` component to the title of the
  `SidePanel`. (This may be undesirable. For example, the "Show Side Panel" button will be
  overwritten with the "Tasks Panel" heading.)
- `aria-expanded` won't make sense to screen reader users when the expanded `SidePanel` content
  isn't logically following the control.
- `aria-controls` is unsupported by screen readers and will not allow users to navigate to the
  controlled content.

In the following example, the `controlProps` click handler function is passed down to the
`SecondaryButton` and a toggle state was added to the button using the `aria-pressed` property.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ExternalControl} />

### Right Origin

By default, `SidePanel` uses a `left` origin. This sets the `ToggleButton`'s position and direction
as well as the direction of the animation. But you can set `SidePanel`'s origin to `"right"` to flip
these. As with the left-origin panel, all right-origin styles have bidirecitonal support.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RightOrigin} />

### Always Open

If you do not need `SidePanel`'s' expand / collapse behavior, you can simply omit the `controlProps`
and `ToggleButton`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={AlwaysOpen} />

The majority of `SidePanel`'s logic and funcitonality lives in this container component. Most of
this functionality has been described in the examples above, but there a couple specific callbacks
worth mentioning here.

### onExpandedChange

The `onExpandedChange` callback is called when the boolean `expanded` state is updated. This is a
handy way to hook into these updates to trigger side-effects. Below is an example:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={OnExpandedChange} />

### onStateTransition

While `onExpandedChange` works well for discrete boolean state changes, there may be occasions where
you also need transition states. In these situations, `onStateTransition` is a better fit. This
callback it called on all state transitions and returns the current transtion state. This can be one
of four `SidePanelTransitionStates`, `expanding`, `expanded`, `collapsing`, and `collapsed`. Below
is an example:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={OnStateTransition} />
