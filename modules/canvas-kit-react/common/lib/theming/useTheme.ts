 * Hook function to get the correct theme object.
 * @param {Object=} theme - The theme object returned from the emotion ThemeContext
 * (through ThemeProvider). The Canvas Kit theme is namespaced within this variable under the `canvas` key.
 *
 * NOTE: If you are using a class component, you MUST pass the theme.
 * If not passed, the function will try to pull the theme from ThemeContext.
 * If that does not work, it will try to retrieve it from the window object.
 * As a last resort, it will return the default Canvas theme.
 *
 * The resulting theme will be merged with the default Canvas theme
 * (using memoized createCanvasTheme()) to establish any missing fields that have
 * not been defined by the consumer's theme object.
 *
 * Providing the default theme here is currently a work around for when no
 * ThemeProvider or context exists.
 * Tracked on https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/1193.
