# Canvas Kit Loading Sparkles

`LoadingSparkles` is a loading animation that makes users aware an AI operation is in progress.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`LoadingSparkles` is designed to work out-of-the-box, but you'll need to add some wiring for screen
readers. In the example below, we're simulating a loading state with a `setTimeout` that's triggered
when the "Generate Quote" button is clicked.

The ARIA live region uses the `aria-label` on `LoadingSparkles` to announce the loading state. And
it uses the text in `AccessibleHide` to announce when loading is complete. In a real-world
application, you would probably add another state for loading failures. Also note that generated
text should live outside the live region. This content doesn't need to be announced to screen
readers.

#### Consolidating ARIA Live Regions

In the example, we wrapped `LoadingSparkles` inside our `AriaLiveRegion` component, but in general
you should not have multiple ARIA live regions on the page at once. If you already have a live
region, consider sending these loading messages there instead of adding another region.
