# Canvas Kit Pill

Pills are static or interactive elements that allow users to input, filter, or label information.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

Pills are used to visually label objects on a page for quick recognition. Theyâ€™re offered as both
static, read-only and interactive elements. They allow users to input a section, filter a list or
table, or label information to help with scanning and organization.

### Basic

If only text is rendered by the Pill, it will look like a `read only` pill. This is a non
interactive element that is used to display some information.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

## Pills with Icon, Avatar or Count

All leading elements (icons or avatars) are intended to be descriptive, helping support the label.
Do not rely on the leading element to indicate the interaction behavior.

You can define an `interactive` Pill by providing an `onClick` prop.

```tsx
<Pill onClick={() => console.warn('clicked')}>
  <Pill.Avatar />
  Regina Skeltor
</Pill>
```

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ClickablePillWithAvatar} />

### With Icon

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ClickablePillWithIcon} />

### With Count

The count appears after indicating the action is directly related to the count of that label.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ClickablePillWithCount} />

## Pills that are removable

Pills that are removable display the X icon following after the label. Removable pills have a
smaller, more specific focus state and click target to be more intentional about its action and to
avoid unintended removal of a Pill.

You can define a removable pill by providing an `onDelete` click handler.

```tsx
<Pill onDelete={() => console.warn('clicked')}>
  Pink Shirts
  <Pill.IconButton />
</Pill>
```

In this case, we use a `Pill.IconButton` because the `X` becomes the focusable and clickable
element.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RemovablePill} />

## Showing a list of Pills

Pills can often represent multiple pieces of information such as a filtered list of categories or
skills.

In order to achieve this, you can use our `HStack` component to wrap each `Pill` and space it out
accordingly.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ListOfPills} />
