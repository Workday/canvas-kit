# Canvas Kit Form Field

FormField allows users to wrap input components to make them accessible. You usually won't want to
use FormField directly but instead should use the specific component you need, e.g. `TextInput`.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Customizing With Behavior Hooks Example

If you need full customization you can use the form field behavior hooks to build your own solution.
It is also easy it work with custom components or third party libraries and get the CKR
accessibility guarantees by using the `as` prop.
