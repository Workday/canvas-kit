# Canvas Kit Form Field

FormField allows users to wrap input components to make them accessible. You can customize the field
by passing in `TextInput`, `Select`, `RadioGroup` and other form elements to `FormField.Input`.

## Installation

yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Customizing With Behavior Hooks Example

If you need full customization you can use the `FormField` behavior hooks to build your own
solution. It is also easy it work with custom components or third party libraries and get the CKR
accessibility guarantees by using the `as` prop.
