# Canvas Kit Form Field

FormField allows users to wrap input components to make them accessible. You usually won't want to
use FormField directly but instead should use the specific component you need, e.g. `TextInput`.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Customizing With Behavior Hooks Example

If you need full customization you can use the `FormField` behavior hooks to build your own
solution. It is also easy it work with custom components or third party libraries and get the CKR
accessibility guarantees by using the `as` prop.

### Use with Select

For some custom inputs, such as Canvas Kit's `Select`, you won't be able to reliably cast the
`FormField.Input` with the `as` prop. Instead you'll want to use `FormField`'s hooks for the
implementation. In the example below, we're using the `useFormFieldModel` hook to hoist the model
and providing it to the `useFormFieldInput` behavior hook. Then we pass the model to the `FormField`
component and the input props to `Select`. This connects `Select` to the `FormField` components and
provides it with all the accessible attributes it needs.
