# Canvas Kit MultiSelect

MultiSelect inputs allow users to choose multiple options from a list of items.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`MultiSelect` supports a
[dynamic API](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/collection-api/#dynamic-items) where you
pass an array of items via the `items` prop and provide a render function to display the items. The
items may be provided as an
[array of strings](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/collection-api/#array-of-strings) or an
[array of objects](/getting-started/for-developers/resources/collection-api/#array-of-objects).

`MultiSelect` should be used in tandem with [Form Field](/components/inputs/form-field/) where the
`MultiSelect` wraps the `FormField` element and the `FormField` element wraps the children of
`MultiSelect` to meet accessibility standards. This ensures the `label` text from `FormField` is
attached to the `MultiSelect.Input` and read out as a group for voiceover.

```tsx
<MultiSelect items={options}>
  <FormField label="Your Label">
    <MultiSelect.Input onChange={e => handleChange(e)} id="contact-multi-select" />
    <MultiSelect.Popper>
      <MultiSelect.Card>
        <MultiSelect.List>
          {item => <MultiSelect.Item>{item.id}</MultiSelect.Item>}
        </MultiSelect.List>
      </MultiSelect.Card>
    </MultiSelect.Popper>
  </FormField>
</MultiSelect>
```

### Disabled Example

Disabling `MultiSelect` involves passing the `disabled` prop to the `MultiSelect.Input` component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Disabled} />

### Error States

The `MultiSelect.Input` and `MultiSelect.SearchInput` support the `ErrorType` from the Common
package. The error styling is identical to the `TextInput` error styling. The `error` prop is
typically passed from the `FormField` component.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Error} />

### Complex

When registering items in an array of objects, it's common to have the text that is displayed to the
user be different than an id. In this example, `serverId` and `label` properties need to be remapped
to `id` and `text` hence the usage of `getId` and `getTextValue`. If your object has the properties
`text` and `id`, there would be no need for this.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Complex} />

### With Icons

Use `MultiSelect.Item.Icon` to render an icon for a `MultiSelect.Item`. The `icon` prop for
`MultiSelect.Item.Icon` accepts [system icons](/assets/system-icons/) from
`@workday/canvas-system-icons-web`.

> **Note: `data-id` on `MultiSelect.Item` must match the `id` property in your array of objects.
> This ensures proper keyboard handling and type-ahead.**

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Icons} />

### Controlled

The MultiSelect can be a controlled input component by passing the `value` and `onChange` to either
the `<MultiSelect>` component or the `<MultiSelect.Input>` component. Internally, the
`MultiSelect.Input` watches for changes on the `value` React prop as well as the `value` DOM
property and will update the model accordingly.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Controlled} />

### Searching

A MultiSelect input can be used as a filter for results. Most likely this also means there are many
items that may not be all be loaded from the server at once. The `useComboboxLoader` can be used to
dynamically load items as the user navigates the available options.

> **Note:** The behavior of search is experimental. The example should continue to work without
> modification, but how the searchable input is presented to the user may change with user testing.
> Don't rely too much on the exact behavior of the search input. For example, the search input may
> be cleared when the user blurs the field.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Searching} />

### Initial Selected Items

You can set `initialSelectedIds` to the value that you want initially selected.
