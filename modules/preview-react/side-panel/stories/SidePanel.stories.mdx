# Canvas Kit Side Panel

`SidePanel` is a collaspible container that anchors to the left or right side of the screen.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/containers/side-panel)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`SidePanel` is composed of three parts:

- The panel container
- An accessible name (either on a visible element or hidden)
- A toggle button to control the expand / collapse states

Bidirectional support is built into `SidePanel`. As seen in the example below, CSS Flexbox flips the
page layout and the panel's contents. `SidePanel` also has logic to flip the position and direction
of the `ToggleButton` as well as the direction of the expand / collapse animation. If you're using
CSS Flexbox for layouts and using the provided components, you shouldn't have to provide any custom
logic or styling for bidirecitonal support.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Hidden Name

`SidePanel` should always have an accessible label. Often this is the heading element with an `id`
attribute. However, as seen in the example below, you can apply a `hidden` attribute to your label
if you do not want it to be visible.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={HiddenName} />

### Alternate Variant

`SidePanel` has one variant, `alternate`, which you can supply as a top-level prop. Default depth of
`alternate` variant is 5, if `alternate` SidePanel has an overlay behavior the depth 6 should be
used (this case is covered in the Examples section).

<ExampleCodeBlock code={AlternatePanel} />

### External Control

Sometimes you'll want to control `SidePanel`'s' expand / collapse behavior from outside the
component. In that case, you can use the `controlProps` supplied by the `useSidePanel` hook.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ExternalControl} />

### Right Origin

By default, `SidePanel` uses a `left` origin. This sets the `ToggleButton`'s position and direction
as well as the direction of the animation. But you can set `SidePanel`'s origin to `"right"` to flip
these. As with the left-origin panel, all right-origin styles have bidirecitonal support.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RightOrigin} />

### Always Open

If you do not need `SidePanel`'s' expand / collapse behavior, you can simply omit the `controlProps`
and `ToggleButton`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={AlwaysOpen} />

The majority of `SidePanel`'s logic and funcitonality lives in this container component. Most of
this functionality has been described in the examples above, but there a couple specific callbacks
worth mentioning here.

### onExpandedChange

The `onExpandedChange` callback is called when the boolean `expanded` state is updated. This is a
handy way to hook into these updates to trigger side-effects. Below is an example:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={OnExpandedChange} />

### onStateTransition

While `onExpandedChange` works well for discrete boolean state changes, there may be occasions where
you also need transition states. In these situations, `onStateTransition` is a better fit. This
callback it called on all state transitions and returns the current transtion state. This can be one
of four `SidePanelTransitionStates`, `expanding`, `expanded`, `collapsing`, and `collapsed`. Below
is an example:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={OnStateTransition} />
