# Canvas Kit Side Panel

`SidePanel` is a collaspible container that anchors to the left or right side of the screen.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/containers/side-panel)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`SidePanel` is composed of three parts:

- The panel container
- An accessible name (either on a visible element or hidden)
- A toggle button to control the expand / collapse states

Bidirectional support is built into `SidePanel`. As seen in the example below, CSS Flexbox flips the
page layout and the panel's contents. `SidePanel` also has logic to flip the position and direction
of the `ToggleButton` as well as the direction of the expand / collapse animation. If you're using
CSS Flexbox for layouts and using the provided components, you shouldn't have to provide any custom
logic or styling for bidirecitonal support.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Hidden Name

`SidePanel` should always have an accessible label. Often this is the heading element with an `id`
attribute. However, as seen in the example below, you can apply a `hidden` attribute to your label
if you do not want it to be visible.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={HiddenName} />

### Alternate Variant

`SidePanel` has one variant, `alternate`, which you can supply as a top-level prop.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={AlternatePanel} />

### External Control

Sometimes you'll want to control `SidePanel`'s' expand / collapse behavior from outside the
component. In that case, you can use the `controlProps` supplied by the `useSidePanel` hook.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={ExternalControl} />

### Right Origin

By default, `SidePanel` uses a `left` origin. This sets the `ToggleButton`'s position and direction
as well as the direction of the animation. But you can set `SidePanel`'s origin to `"right"` to flip
these. As with the left-origin panel, all right-origin styles have bidirecitonal support.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RightOrigin} />

### Always Open

If you do not need `SidePanel`'s' expand / collapse behavior, you can simply omit the `controlProps`
and `ToggleButton`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={AlwaysOpen} />

## Components

### SidePanel

#### Usage

The majority of `SidePanel`'s logic and funcitonality lives in this container component. Most of
this functionality has been described in the examples above, but there a couple specific callbacks
worth mentioning here.

##### onExpandedChange

The `onExpandedChange` callback is called when the boolean `expanded` state is updated. This is a
handy way to hook into these updates to trigger side-effects. Below is an example:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={OnExpandedChange} />

##### onStateTransition

While `onExpandedChange` works well for discrete boolean state changes, there may be occasions where
you also need transition states. In these situations, `onStateTransition` is a better fit. This
callback it called on all state transitions and returns the current transtion state. This can be one
of four `SidePanelTransitionStates`, `expanding`, `expanded`, `collapsing`, and `collapsed`. Below
is an example:

<ExampleCodeBlock code={OnStateTransition} />

#### Props

<ArgsTable of={SidePanel} />

### SidePanel.ToggleButton

#### Usage

`<SidePanel.ToggleButton>` is a control that is meant to toggle between `expanded = true` and
`expanded = false` states. It must be used within the `SidePanel` component as a child. Use in
conjunction with `useSidePanel`'s `controlProps`, otherwise it does not come with explicit `onClick`
handlers.

For accessibility purposes, it must be the first focusable element. We recommend that you keep it as
the first child of `SidePanel`.

#### Props

This is a standard Canvas Kit `IconButton` and will accept
[all those props](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit?path=/docs/components-buttons-button-react-icon-button--circle#props).

## Hooks

### useSidePanel

#### Usage

This hook manages the state and `aria-` attributes for the SidePanel. It takes an optional
configuration object:

<ArgsTable of={UseSidePanel} />

Below is an example:

```tsx
import {useSidePanel} from '@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react/side-panel';

const {expanded, setExpanded, panelProps, labelProps, controlProps} = useSidePanel({
  initialExpanded: false,
  panelId: 'custom-panel-id',
  labelId: 'custom-label-id',
});
```

#### Props

The hook returns an object containing `expanded`, `setExpanded`, and a props for the panel, label,
and control.

##### Panel Props

<ArgsTable of={Panel} />

##### Label Props

<ArgsTable of={Label} />

##### Control Props

<ArgsTable of={Control} />
