<Meta title="Preview/Status Indicator/React" component={StatusIndicator} />

Status Indicators help the user quickly identify the status of a task, action, or page element.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

A basic status indicator will render some text with a gray background and low emphasis.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Emphasis

Emphasis dictates the contrast between the text and background color and is typically used when you
need to show more visual urgency.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Emphasis} />

### Icon

You can add an icon to the status indicator as a visual decorator. You can control the position of
the icon depending on where you place it in the structure.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Icon} />

### Overflow

We strongly discourage the text of a StatusIndicator exceeding its max width which is set to
`200px`. However, in the case where text is overflowed, we suggest your wrap the StatusIndicator in
an `OverflowTooltip` as well as adding a `tabIndex={0}` so that the overflowed text is accessible
via keybord or mouse. You also have access to change the default `maxWidth` via style props.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Overflow} />

### Variants

A status indicator has different variants which define the background color of it. The variants
include: `gray, orange, blue, green, red, transparent`. Based on the `emphasis` the variant will
either be dark or light.
