<Meta title="Preview/Status Indicator/React" component={StatusIndicator} />

Status Indicators help the user quickly identify the status of a task, action, or page element.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

A basic status indicator will render some text with a gray background and low emphasis.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Emphasis

Emphasis dictates the contrast between the text and background color and is typically used when you
need to show more visual urgency.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Emphasis} />

### Icon

You can add an icon to the status indicator as a visual decorator. You can control the position of
the icon depending on where you place it in the structure.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Icon} />

### Overflow

Although not encouraged, a status indicator will handle overflow text in cases where the text
exceeds the max width of the container. For clarity and best experience we encourage consumers to
place minimal amounts of text so that it is all visible. You can also control the `maxWidth` of the
container as well as the placement of the tooltip with `tooltipProps`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Overflow} />

### Variants

A status indicator has different variants which define the background color of it. The variants
include: `gray, orange, blue, green, red, transparent`. Based on the `emphasis` the variant will
either be dark or light.
