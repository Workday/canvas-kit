# Canvas Kit Information Highlight

An `Information Highlight` draws user attention to important details

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage
`Information Highlight` should be used to call out important elements of the page. It has three variants and two emphases
built in.

Variants: Informational, Caution, Attention

Emphasis: Low, High

The variants have different icons and colors to convey severity, the emphasis changes the background color to have a
lower or higher contrast. If no variant or emphasis is selected the layout will default to Informational, Low.

### Basic Example
<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />


## Variants
The following examples will show the low and high emphasis of the three variants.

Low Emphasis will be shown first, and should be used when there is other more important information on the page.

High Emphasis will be shown second, and should be used when the `highlight` is not competing with other, more important information.


### Informational
The Informational Variant is for “nice to have” information, such as related features or opportunities.
<ExampleCodeBlock code={Informational} />

### Caution
The Caution Variant is for “important to know” information, such as the potential consequences of specific actions.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Caution} />


### Critical
The Critical Variant “must know” information that could otherwise cause failure if the user is unaware

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Critical} />


### RTL Example
 Information Highlight also supports RTL Languages. To enable RTL, add a custom theme with direction set to 'ContentDirection.RTL'
<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTL} />

## Partial and Custom Information Highlights

`Information Highlights` can use custom icons or be designed to only use some of its components.

### Custom Icon: Critical
<ExampleCodeBlock code={IconCritical} />

### Body Only Example
<ExampleCodeBlock code={Body} />

### Heading Only Example
<ExampleCodeBlock code={Heading} />
