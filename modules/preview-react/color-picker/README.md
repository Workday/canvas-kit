# Canvas Kit React Color Picker

</a>  This component is in Preview because it has not been converted to a [Compound Component](../../docs/mdx/COMPOUND_COMPONENTS.mdx) yet. There is also work other teams are doing on Color Picker that may replace this implementation.

Color Picker is a popup for selecting a color.

The Color Picker is designed to be used different contexts. The pattern shown below is one where the
Color Picker is used as a popup from a button target by using hooks around the callbacks provided by
the component.

## Installation

```sh
preview-react add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import ColorPicker from '@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react/color-picker';
import {colors} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/tokens';
import {SecondaryButton} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/button';
import {Popper, Popup} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/popup';

const MyComponent: React.FunctionComponent = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const [color, setColor] = React.useState('');
  const ref = React.useRef(null);

  const toggleOpen = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);

  const handleSubmit = React.useCallback(
    (submitColor: string) => {
      setColor(submitColor.toUpperCase());
      setIsOpen(false);
    },
    [setIsOpen]
  );

  return (
    <>
      <SecondaryButton ref={ref} variant="primary" onClick={toggleOpen}>
        Toggle Color Picker
      </SecondaryButton>
      <Popper placement={'bottom'} open={isOpen} anchorElement={ref.current!}>
        <Popup style={{marginTop: 8}} padding={PopupPadding.s}>
          <ColorPicker
            resetColor={colors.blueberry400}
            resetLabel={'Reset'}
            showCustomHexInput={true}
            onColorChange={handleSubmit}
            onColorReset={() => handleSubmit(colors.blueberry400)}
            onSubmitClick={toggleOpen}
            value={color}
          />
        </Popup>
      </Popper>
    </>
  );
};
```
