# Canvas Kit Table

`Table` is a simple styled compound component that renders a
[table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element. It is used to
present information in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing
data.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Users may not want to use a `caption` so they can import
[Heading](/docs/components-text-heading--basic) or [Text](/docs/components-text-text--basic)
instead. This will give the user more flexibility around the customization of the title/heading of
their table.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BasicWithHeading} />

### Example with Container

Users may want to have some padding around the `table` and have inset dividers for their rows. This
showcases how a user can achieve this with creating a styled component to wrap the `table`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={TableWithContainer} />

### Example with Caption

We built a simple table that includes a `caption` without a Heading. A `caption` is not required but
it is good for
[accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table#accessibility_concerns)
purposes.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Fixed Column with TableContainer

Users may want to have some padding surrounding their table and have a fixed column. They can use
the `TableContainer` to wrap the `Table` component and some styles to make it so that the left
column is fixed.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FixedColumn} />
