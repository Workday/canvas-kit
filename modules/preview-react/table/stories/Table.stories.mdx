# Canvas Kit Table

`Table` is a simple styled compound component that renders a
[table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element. It is used to
present information in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing
data.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example with Heading

In this example, users may not want to use a `caption` so they can import
[Heading](/docs/components-text-heading--basic) or [Text](/docs/components-text-text--basic)
instead. This will give the user more flexibility around the customization of the title/heading of
their table.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={BasicWithHeading} />

### Basic Example with Caption

In this example, we built a simple table that includes a `caption`. A `caption` is not required but
it is good for
[accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table#accessibility_concerns)
purposes.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Fixed Column and Column Dividers

In this example, users may want to have columns divided and have a fixed left column for their
headers so users can scroll horizontally on bigger data sets.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={FixedColumn} />
