## Advanced Table Examples

Out of the box, `Table` is a lightweight component with a high degree of flexibility, but not much
functionality outside of providing a basic table layout. This leaves a gap for developers to
implement common features, such as selecting rows and sorting columns, on top of `Table` to meet
their specific application needs. During the development process, it's often unclear how to
implement these features in an accessible way. In an effort to reduce that gap and increase clarity,
we've documented several advanced examples below to communicate the accessibility nuances alongside
tangible code snippets.

### Expandable Rows

Expandable Rows combines the likes of an accordion with tabular data tables. Column 1 renders icon
buttons with 2 states, a collapsed and expanded state. A new row that spans the entire width of the
table is added to the table just after the expanded row.

- The `aria-expanded` property is added to the button to communicate this state to screen reader
  users.
- A Canvas accessible `Tooltip` component is used to assign names to each icon button based on the
  most useful value in the row. In this example, we combined the car make and model together. This
  allows everyone to view the name of the checkboxes by hovering the mouse or focusing with the
  keyboard.
- The expanded row uses `colspan` to span the entire width of the table and support screen readers.
  This space provides flexibility to show headings, lists, and other structured content for the
  table row above.
- There is no explicit relationship between a row of cells, and the spanned content below it. The
  spanned content is assumed to belong to the row of cells above it, based on established accordion
  patterns and logical reading order of content rendered to the screen.
- Outlining hierarchy in a data table is not supported for screen readers in this example.

### Selectable Rows

Developed by the Workday accessibility team, using a `Checkbox` labeled "Select All" inside of a table
column header can be a confusing experience for screen reader users. Screen readers will
automatically announce the "Select All" column header each time users are reading any cell in
column 1. For instance, the `Checkbox` in row 4 is decidedly not going to select all of the rows. Here
is what we did about it:

- We intentionally rendered row 1, column 1 as a standard `<td>` element so screen readers won't
  automatically announce "Select All" while reading cells in column 1.
- Our research found that VoiceOver (MacOS v12.7, Safari v17.1) persistently announce "Select All"
  despite using the `<td>` element because of the optional `<thead>` element in the table. We
  omitted the optional `<thead>` and `<tbody>` elements from this example for that reason.
- We used Canvas' accessible `Tooltip` component to assign names to each Checkbox based on the most
  useful value in the row, the topping name. This allows everyone to view the name of the checkboxes
  by hovering the mouse or focusing with the keyboard.
- We rendered the cells in column 2 as the row headers for the table, enabling screen readers to
  automatically announce the topping name even while reading down the Amounts in column 3. When we
  rendered column 1 as row headers, then reading down column 2 (Topping Name) sounded redundant
  because the `Checkbox` names in column 1 are identical to the Topping Name in column 2.

### Sortable Column Headers

The challenge in this example is, how will we clearly communicate the complexity of the column
headers to screen readers and keep the tabular data easy to understand? The column headers must
describe the column name, the current sort state of the column, they are interactive (a button), and
instructions about how the column will be sorted next. When screen reader users are focused on the
tabular data cells, instructions about how the column will be sorted next is probably not relevant,
distracting, and makes it harder to understand the data.

- The `aria-sort` property has been initialized to `none` on each of the `<th>` elements; this value
  is updated to `ascending` or `descending` to reflect the current state.
- A `<button>` element describing the column name is used inside of the `<th>` column header.
- The `describe` variant of the Canvas `Tooltip` component is applied to the button in the column
  header. This is used to describe how the column will be sorted after interaction and applied to
  the accessible description of the button with the `aria-describedby` property. This way screen
  readers won't read the longer description of the column headers automatically while focusing on
  the tabular data below.
- The `aria-sort` property may not reliably provide the current sort state of the column to users
  focused on the tabular data in the table. It may be more reliable to use an `aria-label` string on
  the button that describes the column name and sort state together.
