# Canvas Kit Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs allow users to keep track and maintain awareness of their location as they navigate
through pages, folders, files, etc.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/navigation/breadcrumbs)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

`Breadcrumbs.List` is a styled unordered list `<ul>` with no additional behaviors. Use this when you
are not concerned about collapsing the list of breadcrumb items into a dropdown menu at a specified
width.

Accessibility is built into Breadcrumbs components in a way that allows you to create an inclusive
experience with little additional configuration. The only ARIA label you'll need to add is the
`aria-label` for `Breadcrumbs.Nav` as seen in the example. And all links require `href`s to be
properly identified. All other accessible attributes are baked into the components.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Collapsible List

`Breadcrumbs.CollapsibleList` is built on top of `Breadcrumbs.List`. It provides additional
functionality to collapse list items into a dropdown menu at a specified width.

In addition to adding `aria-label` to `Breadcrumbs.Nav` and identifying all links with an `href`,
you'll need to add `buttonAriaLabel` to `Breadcrumbs.CollapsibleList`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CollapsibleList} />

### Right-to-Left (RTL)

Breadcrumbs has bidirectional support out of the box. That means outside of setting the content
direction in your application's Canvas theme, you don't need to do anything else to make it work.
All you need to supply is the translated text for items and ARIA labels.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTLCollapsibleList} />

## Components

### Breadcrumbs.Nav

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.Nav` a styled `<nav>` element. It has no intrinsic state or behaviors.

#### Props

This component also supports
[all native HTMLElement props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.Nav} />

---

### Breadcrumbs.List

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.List` component is a styled, unordered list (`<ul>`) with no additional behaviors. Use
this when you're not concerned about collapsing the list of breadcrumb items into a dropdown menu at
a specified width.

#### Props

`Breadcrumbs.List` has no component-specific props. However, it supports
[all native `<ul>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul#Attributes).

---

### Breadcrumbs.CollapsibleList

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.CollapsibleList` is built on top of `Breadcrumbs.List`. It provides additional
functionality to collapse list items into a dropdown menu at a specified width.

The `maxWidth` prop sets the point to collapse. If the length of the list exceeds that value, items
will be collapsed into a dropdown menu. Note that the first (root) item and last (current) items in
the list will never be collapsed.

##### Handling Custom Dropdown Button Icons

By default the icon for the dropdown button is `relatedActionsIcon`. However, you can set this to
any [Canvas System Icon](https://design.workday.com/tokens/assets/icons/system-icons) with the
`buttonIcon` prop. Please consult the Canvas team if you decide to do this, as we'd like to keep
breadcrumb navigation as consistent as possible.

#### Props

This component also supports
[all native `<ul>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul#Attributes).

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.CollapsibleList} />

---

### Breadcrumbs.ListItem

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.ListItem` is a styled `<li>` element that contains a `SystemIcon` separator.

#### Props

`Breadcrumbs.ListItem` has no component-specific props. However, it supports
[all native `<li>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#Attributes).

---

### Breadcrumbs.Link

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.Link` is a styled `<a>` element that also renders a tooltip if the text is truncated.
The built-in truncation + tooltip functionality provides an easy-to-use, accessible feature for
managing the length of link text. The `maxWidth` is set to `350px` by default and can be adjusted as
needed. Note that tooltips will only render when text is truncated. Here's an example with the
`maxWidth` set to `150px`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={LinkTruncation} />

##### Handling Redirects

`Breadcrumbs.Link` defaults to redirecting with an `href`, meaning the page will hard-redirect when
the link is clicked. However, if you're in a single-page application (SPA) environment, you might
want to use the internal SPA router instead. You can override this hard-redirect with the `onAction`
prop. Note that `onAction` will not block any `onClick` if provided. Below is an example using the
`history` package.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
// using the history package
import {createBrowserHistory} from 'history';
import {Breadcrumbs} from '@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react/breadcrumbs';

// this is likely being done at the root of your application and not inside this component.
const history = createBrowserHistory();

const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement, MouseEvent>) => {
  // handle any click side-effects here
  console.log('click event', event);
}

const handleRedirect = (href: string) => {
  // redirect using the internal SPA router
  history.push(href);
}

return (
  <Breadcrumbs.Link
    href="/account"
    onAction={handleRedirect}
    onClick={handleClick}
  >
    Account
  </Breadcrumbs.Link>;
)
```

#### Props

This component also supports
[all native `<a>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#Attributes).

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.Link} />

---

### Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem

#### Usage

`Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem` is a styled `<li>` element also renders a tooltip if the text is
truncated. The built-in truncation + tooltip functionality provides an easy-to-use, accessible
feature for managing the length of link text. The `maxWidth` is set to `350px` by default and can be
adjusted as needed. Normally, this is a non-focusable element. But when truncated, it sets the
`tabIndex` to `0` to enable the tooltip to appear on keyboard focus. Note that tooltips will only
render when text is truncated. Here's an example with the `maxWidth` set to `100px`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={CurrentItemTruncation} />

#### Props

This component also supports
[all native `<li>` element props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#Attributes).

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumbs.CurrentItem} />
