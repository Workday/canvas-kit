# Canvas Kit Radio

Radio Buttons allow a user to select one value from a predefined list of 7 or fewer options.

[> Workday Design Reference](https://design.workday.com/components/inputs/radio-buttons)

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Our radio component includes a `RadioGroup` container and `RadioGroup.RadioButton`, which renders an
individual radio button. Nest related `RadioGroup.RadioButton` buttons within a `RadioGroup` and
provide a `name` prop to the `RadioGroup` to group the radio buttons together. Each
`RadioGroup.Radio` must have a unique `value`. This value is used in conjunction with the `value`
prop set on the `RadioGroup` to determine which radio button is selected. To tie it all together,
provide an `onChange` handler to the `RadioGroup` to track the selected value as it changes.

`RadioGroup` should be used in tandem with [Form Field](/components/inputs/form-field/) where the
`useFieldset` prop is set to `true` to meet accessibility standards. This ensures the `label` text
from `FormField` is attached to the `RadioGroup` and read out as a group for voiceover.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

Our example uses [React state](<(https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory)>) to track the
value of the `RadioGroup`.

`RadioGroup` and `RadioGroup.Radio` support keyboard navigation through the proper use of WAI-ARIA
[properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/radiogroup_role#associated_wai-aria_roles_states_and_properties).

### Inverse

Set the `variant` prop of `RadioGroup.RadioButton` to `inverse` to ensure proper contrast on dark
backgrounds.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Inverse} />

### Radio Group with No Value

Omit the `value` prop from `RadioGroup` to render the group with no selected
`RadioGroup.RadioButton`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={NoValue} />

### Ref Forwarding

`RadioGroup.RadioButton` supports [ref forwarding](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html).
It will forward `ref` to its underlying `<input type="radio">` element.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={RefForwarding} />

### Label Position

Set the `orientation` prop of the Form Field to designate the position of the label relative to the
input component. By default, the orientation will be set to `vertical`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={LabelPosition} />

### Required

Set the `required` prop of the wrapping `FormField` to `true` to indicate that the field is
required. Labels for required fields are suffixed by a red asterisk.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Required} />

### Disabled

Set the `disabled` prop of `RadioGroup.RadioButton` to prevent users from interacting with it. Be
careful not to disable a pre-selected radio button as this will block keyboard access to the entire
`RadioGroup`.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Disabled} />

### Custom Radio Button

Use `RadioGroup.Label` instead of `RadioGroup.RadioButton` if you need direct access to the label
and the radio input. This will allow you to apply custom styling to the text and radio input.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Custom} />

### Standalone Radio Button

Use `StyledRadioButton` when you want a styled radio button on its own without using `RadioGroup`.
You will need to handle behavior and accessibility.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={StandaloneRadio} />

Use `RadioGroup.Label` when you want more control styling the text and radio input but still want
some behavior handled for you.

### Error States

Set the `error` prop of the wrapping `FormField` to `"caution"` or
`"error"` to set the `RadioGroup` to the alert or error state, respectively. You
will also need to set the `hintId` and `hintText` props on the `FormField` to meet accessibility
standards. You must set an `aria-describedby` attribute on the `RadioGroup` element that matches the
value of `hintId` set on the `FormField` element. These attributes ensure that the alert message is
associated to the `RadioGroup` and read out by voiceover.

#### Caution

Use the alert state when a selection is valid but there is additional information.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Caution} />

#### Error

Use the error state when the selection is no longer valid.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Error} />

### React Hook Form

Using a form library like [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/) is a common use case.
Reference this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/radio-preview-with-react-hook-form-stn5vr) on
how to use `RadioGroup` with React Hook Form.

### Custom Styles

Radio and its subcomponents support custom styling via the `cs` prop. For more information, check

["How To Customize Styles"](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-guides-customizing-styles--docs).
