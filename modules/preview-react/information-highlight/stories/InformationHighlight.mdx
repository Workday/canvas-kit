# Canvas Kit Information Highlight

A container to call out important information on a page or a section of a page that the user should be aware of.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-preview-react
```

## Usage

`InformationHighlight` should be used to call out important information to the user and are paired with a meaningful
 icon and color to differentiate information type. It should not be removed from the interface until some system or admin level action has been taken to do so.

You can use an `InformationHighlight` to:
- Prevent unwanted consequences from destructive actions
- Reassure users in their next steps
- Provide detail into information on the page
- Show changes in page content

### When to Consider Something Else
- Consider a [Banner](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-indicators-banner--docs) if the message is about system-wide errors or alerts, or if the message appears in response to user action.
- Consider a [Dialog](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-popups-dialog--docs) if the message is critical and requires user action or decision before proceeding
- Consider a [Toast](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-popups-toast--docs) if the message is timely, such as communicating updates on the process of an application.
### Basic Example
<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />


## Variants
`InformationHighlight` has three variants and each `variant` has two types of `emphasis`.


Variants: `informational`, `caution`, `critical`

Emphasis: `low`, `high`


The variants have different icons and colors to convey severity and the emphasis changes the background color to have a
 lower or higher contrast. If no `variant` or `emphasis` is selected the layout will default to
  `Variant: informational, Emphasis: low`.


The following examples will show the `low` and `high` emphasis of the three variants.
`low` Emphasis will be shown first and should be used when there is other more important information on the page.
`high` Emphasis will be shown second, and should be used when the highlight is not competing with other, more important information.

### Informational
The informational variant is for _nice to have_ information, such as related features or opportunities.
<ExampleCodeBlock code={Informational} />

### Caution
The caution variant is for _important to know_ information, such as the potential consequences of specific actions.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Caution} />


### Critical
The critical variant is for _must know_ information that could otherwise cause failure if the user is unaware

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Critical} />


### RTL Example
 Information Highlight also supports RTL Languages. To enable RTL, add a custom theme with direction set to 'ContentDirection.RTL'
<ExampleCodeBlock code={RTL} />

## Partial and Custom Information Highlights

`InformationHighlight` can use custom icons or be designed to only use some of its components.

### Custom Icon: Critical
<ExampleCodeBlock code={IconCritical} />

### Body Only Example
<ExampleCodeBlock code={Body} />

### Heading Only Example
<ExampleCodeBlock code={Heading} />

### Accessible Use of the `as` Prop
Like many of our components, `InformationHighlight` and it's subcomponents accept an `as` prop, which lets you change
the underlying semantic element. For `InformationHighlight.Heading`, you can change the heading level if you were
needing to define a different level of importance. This should be done with caution to ensure the best accessibility.
