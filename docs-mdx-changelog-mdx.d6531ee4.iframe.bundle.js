(2025-04-23)\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n- [#3101](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3101) `iconLabel` is now a *required* prop. We've removed the default `aria-label` of `Opens link in new window` to better support internationalization. You must provide a value to `iconLabel`.\n- [#3104](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3104) - `maxWidth` has been removed from the `usePillModel`. This config was used to style sub components. With the refactor to use `data-part` and [stencils](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--docs#create-stencil), it is no longer needed on the model. You can still apply `maxWidth` on the parent `<Pill>` element and the child elements will be styled accordingly.\n  - `Pill.Icon` no longer has a default `aria-labe=\"add\"`. You *must* provide an `aria-label` for `Pill.Icon` to ensure proper accessibility. Our examples have been updated to reflect this change.\n  - `Pill.IconButton` no longer has a default `aria-label=\"remove\"`. You *must* provide an `aria-label` for `Pill.IconButton` to ensure proper accessibility. Our examples have been updated to reflect this change.\n  - `Pill.Label` is a required element when using other sub components like `Pill.Icon` to ensure that the label truncates correctly.\n- [#3204](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3204) - If you're using `react@16.x.x`, you'll need to upgrade to `react@17.x.x` to use Canvas Kit v13.\n  >**Note:** You'll need to update the way `jsx` transpiles. The automatic runtime feature, enabled through the `@babel/preset-react` preset with the `runtime: \"automatic\"` option, handles the importing of functions that JSX transpiles to.\n- [#3201](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3201) There is a codemod that should catch a lot of instances but, if there is an instance that is not caught, users will have to update those names manually. See above table for name references.\n- [#3217](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3217) The `Expandable` component has been promoted from `Labs` to `Main`. There is a codemod to handle the update of the imports.\n- [#3231](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3231) The `altText` prop no longer has a default of `\"Avatar\"`.  You *must* provide an `altText` for `<Avatar />, <Pill.Avatar />, <Expandable.Avatar />` to ensure proper accessibility. Our examples have been updated to reflect this change.\n- [#3254](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3254) `horizontal` is no longer a supported value to the `orientation` prop on `FormField` and `FormFieldGroup`. Please use `horizontalStart` instead. This value was deprecated in v12 and a codemod was added to rename the value.\n- [#3265](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3265) The Collection system cursor has been updated to support `string | string[]`. This won't affect direct comparisons like `model.state.cursorId === x` if your use-case doesn't use hierarchy. There may be some edge cases where your code is expecting the `model.state.cursorId` to be a string only. This will have to be updated.\n\n### Branding\n\n- feat: Promote new Dub logos and add codemod to handle change ([#3201](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3201)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  We've removed the old Dub Logos in Main and promoted the new logos that were previously in our Preview package to Main as part of the brand refresh. We've also added a codemod to update the import statements as well as the name of the logos used to the new names. \n  \n  | Old Logo Name | New Logo Name |\n  | --------------- | ----------------- | \n  | dubLogoBlue | dubLogoPrimary | \n  | dubLogoWhite | dubLogoReversed | \n  | wdayLogoBlue | wdayLogoPrimary | \n  | wdayLogoWhite | wdayLogoReversed |\n\n### Components\n\n- feat: Refactor Skeleton to use our new styling utilities and new tokens ([#3088](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3088)) ([@thunguyen19](https://github.com/thunguyen19))\n  We've updated`Skeleton` to use our new Tokens and styling utilities. The React interface has not changed, but CSS variables are now used for dynamic properties.\n- feat: Refactor External Hyperlink to use new styling utilities ([#3101](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3101)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n  We've updated `ExternalHyperlink` to use our new styling utilities and tokens.\n- feat: Refactor Menu and its sub components to use our new styling utilities ([#3114](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3114)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  We've updated ExternalHyperlink to use our new styling utilities and tokens.

This change will only affect style merging from this release on and will not affect any previous version, so it is an opt-in.\n\n\n## [v12.4.6](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.4.6) (2025-02-24)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(combobox): Use focus/blur reconfig vs rewrite for testing library ([#3147](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3147)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## [v12.4.5](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.4.5) (2025-02-21)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Define stable ref reference in `useComboboxInputConstrained` ([#3145](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3145)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v12.4.4](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.4.4) (2025-02-21)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- docs: Add stackblitz support to our example ([#3132](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3132)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v12.4.3](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.4.3) (2025-02-20)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(popup): Fix useReturnFocus to respect tabindex=-1 buttons ([#3141](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3141)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## [v11.2.3](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.2.3) (2025-02-20)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(popup): Fix useReturnFocus to respect tabindex=-1 buttons ([#3141](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3141)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n## [v12.4.2](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.4.2) (2025-02-19)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- fix: Update tooltip mdx to correctly render ([#3139](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3139)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v12.4.1](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.4.1) (2025-02-19)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- fix: Add missing semicolon to tooltip mdx ([#3138](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3138)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v12.4.0](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.4.0) (2025-02-19)\n\n\n\n\n## [v12.3.7](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.3.7) (2025-02-11)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Ensure width is passed to Select input ([#3130](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3130)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v11.2.2](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.2.2) (2025-02-10)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Ensure width is passed to Select input ([#3130](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3130)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n## [v12.3.6](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.3.6) (2025-02-06)\n\n### Theming\n\n- fix: Remove action tokens from CanvasProvider to allow cascading ([#3125](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3125)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n  The `CanvasProvider` created a cascading barrier for our brand tokens. In the case where `brand.action.**` tokens are defined at the root level, say `:root` in a a CSS file, we want those tokens to cascade through the `CanvasProvider` down to our `PrimaryButton`'s.  To allow this, we've removed them from the `CanvasProvider` and `variables.css`.\n  - `@workday/canvas-tokens-web@2.1.1` **removed** `--cnvs-brand-action-**` tokens from our `variables.css` to ensure proper cascading of this token to theme our `PrimaryButton`'s.\n  - The `CanvasProvider` has **removed** defaulting `brand.action.**` for theming and is longer a valid theme property on `CanvasTheme` type. \n  - In order to ensure proper cascading of the `--cnvs-brand-action-**` token, you **must** upgrade to the latest version of Canvas Kit `v12` **and** whomever is bootstrapping the `variables.css` **must** upgrade  `@workday/canvas-tokens-web` to `@2.1.1` to ensure correct theming.\n\n\n## [v12.3.5](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.3.5) (2025-01-28)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- chore: Update banner image on welcome page ([#3113](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3113)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v12.3.4](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.3.4) (2025-01-28)\n\n\n\n\n## [v12.3.3](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.3.3) (2025-01-13)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- docs: Refreshing preview SidePanel storybook examples ([#3056](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3056)) ([@williamjstanton](https://github.com/williamjstanton), William Stanton)\n\n\n## [v12.3.2](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.3.2) (2025-01-09)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Rename index file to correctly export ([#3098](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3098)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v12.3.1](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.3.1) (2025-01-09)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Update Information Highlight folder name for slash imports ([#3097](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3097)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v12.3.0](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.3.0) (2025-01-09)\n\n\n\n\n## [v12.2.2](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.2.2) (2025-01-07)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Add overflowWrap on MenuItem ([#3094](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3094)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v12.2.1](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.2.1) (2025-01-07)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Added CKR Dub and Logo References to preview package ([#3093](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3093)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n\n\n## [v11.2.1](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.2.1) (2025-01-07)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Added CKR Dub and Logo References to preview package ([#3093](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3093)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n## [v12.2.0](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v12.2.0) (2025-01-07)\n\n### Components\n\n- feat: Update CKR Dub and Logo References ([#3089](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/3089)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  Workday has new logos with updated colors.

The `variant` type prop now accepts `\"dark\" | \"light\"`\n  - The `as` prop now accepts any element, not just `div`.\n- [#2674](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2674) Codemods formatting have been updated and users will need to format their files after the codemod has been used.\n- [#2934](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2934) The newly promoted `FormField` is a\n  [compound component](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/guides-compound-components--page).\n  Due to the different APIs of the component, this change is **not codemodable**. The following shows\n  an example of how to **update** your code to match the new compound component API.\n  \n  ```tsx\n  // v11 FormField in Main\n  <FormField\n    error={FormField.ErrorType.Alert}\n    labelPosition={FormField.LabelPosition.Left}\n    useFieldSet={true}\n    required={true}\n    hintId=\"hint-alert\"\n    hintText=\"Please enter a valid email.\"\n    label=\"Email\"\n  >\n    <TextInput onChange={handleChange} value={value} />\n  </FormField>\n  \n  // v12 Newly promoted FormField from Preview to Main\n  <FormField\n    error=\"error\"\n    orientation=\"horizontalStart\"\n    isRequired={true}\n  >\n  \t<FormField.Label>Email</FormField.Label>\n  \t<FormField.Field>\n  \t\t<FormField.Input as={TextInput} onChange={handleChange} value={value} />\n  \t\t<FormField.Hint>Please enter a valid email.</FormField.Hint>\n  \t</FormField.Field>\n  </FormField>\n  ```\n  \n  **Noticeable changes:**\n  \n  - `error` prop takes in the following values: `\"error\" | \"alert\"`.\n  - `labelPosition` becomes `orientation` with the following values:\n    `\"horizontal\" | \"horizontalStart\" | \"horizontalEnd\" | \"vertical\"`.\n  - `useFieldSet` is no longer valid. If you want to group inputs, use\n    [`FormFieldGroup`](#form-field-group) component.\n  - `required` becomes `isRequired`.\n  - `hintId` is no longer needed. The component handles associating the hint text, label and input\n    automatically. If you wish to have a unique `id`, you can add one onto the `FormField` element.\n  - `hintText` is no longer a valid prop. Use `FormField.Hint` sub component.\n  - `errorLabel` and `alertLabel` are no longer valid props. Customizing your hint text inside of\n    `FormField.Hint`.\n  - `label` is no longer a valid prop. Use `FormField.Label` sub component to render your label text.\n  - Instead of rendering an input, ensure you use `FormField.Input` with the `as` prop. This ensures\n    proper error handling and aria attributes for accessibility.\n- [#2969](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2969) We've removed the `MenuItemProps` export from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/menu`. Use `ExtractProps<typeof Menu.Item, never>` instead. We don't mean to export prop interfaces of polymorphic components. The `never` means \"don't add element props\". The second parameter is used to pass the interface that the `as` prop is pointing to.\n- [#2980](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2980) `elemProps` hooks using `composeHooks` have more accurate type signatures which may lead to new type errors. For information, view our [discussion](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/2979).\n- [#2982](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2982) A list model's `navigation.getItem()` can return `undefined` if no item is found. Previously it threw an error, which cause many problems. It is now up to the caller to decide what to do with an `undefined` return value\n\n### Components\n\n- chore: Removed Select in Preview ([#2796](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2796)) ([@thunguyen19](https://github.com/thunguyen19), manuel.carrera, [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n  We've removed the `Select` component that was in `@workday/canvas-kit-preview-react`. Please use the `Select` in Main (https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/components-inputs-select--basic) which is a compound component and offers more flexibility.\n  \n  Thank You Picture \n  \n  <img width=\"497\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/assets/32447341/3372b8dd-c963-4f7e-84bb-791f0889df57\">\n- chore: Modal, Dialog, Popup and Toast Styles Refactor ([#2795](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2795)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  Updated `Modal, Dialog, Popup and Toast` to use new `system` tokens and style utilities.\n- chore: Removal of InputIconContainer ([#2838](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2838)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  We've removed `InputIconContainer` from Main.

These changes are intended to provide more flexibility with label alignments on FormField elements.\n  \n  Instances where the orientation prop of the FormField component is set to `horizontal` will automatically default to `horizontalStart` via a codemod. A console warning message will also appear with a message to change the prop value to either horizontalStart or horizontalEnd.\n- chore: Updated unique id generation for classnames ([#2913](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2913)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- chore: Add FormFieldGroup component and density example ([#2865](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2865)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell), [@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n  - We've added a new `FormFieldGroup` component to use when grouping inputs like checkboxes and radio inputs that need to be associated to one another. Its API matches the `FormField` API where you have `error` prop as well as `id` `isRequired` and `orienation`.\n  \n  - `orientation` has been added back to `useFormFieldModel` to better support sub component styling.\n  \n  - Styles have been cleaned up to use `gap` for proper spacing between labels, inputs and hint text.\n  \n  - Added a new `FormField.Field` component to ensure proper alignment between label and inputs regardless of orientation and hint text. Ensure to wrap your inputs and hint text in this component.\n- chore: Revert Select Preview Removal ([#2933](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2933)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n- feat(text-input): Support CSS Variables in InputGroup ([#2935](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2935)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- feat: Promote FormField from Preview to Main ([#2934](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2934)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  We've promoted FormField from [Preview](#preview) to [Main](#main). The following changes have been\n  made to provide more flexibility and better explicit components when using inputs.\n  \n  - The orientation prop on the `FormField` component will be updated to accept the following values:\n    `vertical`, `horizontalStart`, and `horizontalEnd`. `horizontal` will still be accepted as a value\n    in v12, but it will be deprecated and slated for removal in a future major release. These changes\n    are intended to provide more flexibility with label alignments on `FormField` elements.\n  \n  > **Note**: The horizontal alignment of start and end are relative to its container, meaning start\n  > and end match the flex property of `flex-start` and `flex-end`. This is especially applicable for\n  > moving between RTL (right-to-left) and LTR (left-to-right) languages.\n  \n  > **Note:** Orientation \"horizontal\" has been deprecated. You will see a console warn message\n  > suggesting to update your types and usage to `horizontalStart`, `horizontalEnd` or `vertical`.\n  \n  - `useFormFieldModel`: `orientation` has been added back into `useFormFieldModel`. While we still\n    support compat mode due to\n    [style merging issues](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/2893), having orientation\n    on the model allows for proper styling of sub components.\n  \n  - Styles clean up. `FormField.Hint` and `FormField.Label` where using `margin` for spacing. We've\n    updated styles so that the containing element uses `gap` for proper spacing.\n- fix: Add visual testing for inputs after form field promotion ([#2963](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2963)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n- chore(text-input): Convert `InputGroup` to use Stencils ([#2964](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2964)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- feat(form-field): Add a11y links for non-input fields ([#2967](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2967)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll), manuel.carrera)\n- feat(menu): Add `MenuOption` and convert to MenuItem to Stencil ([#2969](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2969)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- fix: Add isHidden to FormField label element ([#2973](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2973)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  If you want to hide the label but maintain accessibility, add the `isHidden` prop on the `FormField.Label` element.\n- fix: Fix mergeProps, createElemPropsHook, and composeHooks types ([#2980](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2980)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- chore: Remove useResizeObserver hack ([#2981](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2981)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- chore: Collection navigation getItem can return undefined ([#2982](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2982)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- fix: Fix InputGroup inner end width calculations ([#2984](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2984)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- refactor(select): Fix all syncing issues with the Select component ([#2983](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2983)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- feat: Add a MultiSelect component ([#2911](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2911)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n### Documentation\n\n- chore: Upgrade Guide Cleanup  ([#2936](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2936)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n- chore: Fix for ExampleCodeBlock ([#2938](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2938)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell), manuel.carrera)\n- docs: Fix Markdown tables ([#2986](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2986)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- chore: Storybook sidebar theme ([#2987](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2987)) ([@jaclynjessup](https://github.com/jaclynjessup))\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n- chore: Upgrade Storybook and Webpack ([#2674](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2674)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose), [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll), manuel.carrera, [@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  - In Storybook, each component now has a \"Docs\" page.

We'll look into possible out-of-order execution issues in the future and plan to re-enable full static mode (for better performance) once we know why this is happening and have a proper workaround.\n  \n  For more information, please read our [discussion](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/2893)\n## [v11.1.5](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.1.5) (2024-08-23)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(combobox): Show selected state when multiple is enabled ([#2882](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2882)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## [v10.3.55](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.3.55) (2024-08-22)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(combobox): Show selected state when multiple is enabled ([#2882](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2882)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n## [v11.1.4](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.1.4) (2024-08-21)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- docs: Update CanvasProvider info on install page ([#2878](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2878)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith))\n\n\n## [v10.3.54](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.3.54) (2024-08-21)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- docs: Update CanvasProvider info on install page ([#2878](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2878)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith))\n## [v11.1.3](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.1.3) (2024-08-20)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Update select to trigger onChange ([#2874](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2874)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v10.3.53](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.3.53) (2024-08-20)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Update select to trigger onChange ([#2874](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2874)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n## [v11.1.2](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.1.2) (2024-08-20)\n\n\n\n\n## [v11.1.1](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.1.1) (2024-08-20)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(select): Clicking the input closes the menu ([#2869](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2869)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## [v10.3.52](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.3.52) (2024-08-14)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(select): Clicking the input closes the menu ([#2869](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2869)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n## [v11.1.0](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.1.0) (2024-08-14)\n\n\n\n\n## [v11.0.27](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.0.27) (2024-08-12)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(Checkbox): Remove console warning ([#2863](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2863)) ([@thunguyen19](https://github.com/thunguyen19))\n\n\n## [v11.0.26](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.0.26) (2024-08-05)\n\n### Accessibility\n\n- fix: Set aria-modal to false for better accessibility ([#2855](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2855)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v10.3.51](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.3.51) (2024-08-05)\n\n### Accessibility\n\n- fix: Set aria-modal to false for better accessibility ([#2855](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2855)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n## [v11.0.25](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v11.0.25) (2024-08-05)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(combobox): Use correct state for aria-selected ([#2849](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2849)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  This change fixes `aria-selected` in `Combobox.Menu.Item` components, but this does change the visuals of what is considered \"selected\".

[#2472](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2472) - The prop `hasError` for Preview components `FormField`, `TexInput` and `TextArea` have been renamed to `error` and accepts  the values: `\"error\" | \"alert\" | undefined`\n- [#2546](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2546) There may be slight visual changes.\n- [#2567](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2567) There may be slight visual changes.\n- [#2583](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2583) There may be slight visual changes.\n- [#2600](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2600) - `rowState` no longer exists.\n  - The component is now a compound component with access to lower level elements.\n- [#2615](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2615) Impacts only internal Canvas Kit code. `Icon` component has been removed and no longer used.\n- [#2697](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2697) Adds `box-sizing: border-box` to all stencils. If your stencil did not add this style already, it may change the way `width` works for the component. Our intent is to make all elements use border box layouts to make width calculations more predictable. This change may change the way your component works if you use the `width` style property.\n\n### <a href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1551452433f17e7cb88cbb052252a70d73e7078ce660fdf88d5285443fc0ac6a/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f72656c656173655f63617465676f72792d436f6d706f6e656e74732d626c7565\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1551452433f17e7cb88cbb052252a70d73e7078ce660fdf88d5285443fc0ac6a/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f72656c656173655f63617465676f72792d436f6d706f6e656e74732d626c7565\" alt=\"category\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></a>\n\n- chore: Refactor StatusIndicator component ([#2620](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2620)) ([@harshanarisetty](https://github.com/harshanarisetty))\n  `StatusIndicator` now uses [Canvas Tokens](https://workday.github.io/canvas-tokens/?path=/docs/docs-getting-started--docs) and our [new styling utilities](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-basics--create-modifiers#createstyles-api).\n  The component now supports the `cs` prop, but otherwise the API has not changed.

any breaking changes, but creating a custom Emotion instance can introduce a breaking change. A custom instance should only be used if all instances of Canvas Kit on the page are above the version this change is released in and no application code is imported directly from `@emotion/css`. This change updates all internal Canvas Kit styling to use the Emotion instance created in `@workday/canvas-kit-styling`. If no custom instance is created, the one created by `@emotion/css` will be used. If the default instance is used, there should be no breaking changes, but everyone should update their application code to use styling functions from `@workday/canvas-kit-styling` and not `@emotion/css`. SSR using `@emotion/css` is unaffected since server to client hydration only cares about the cache key (\"css\") and the style's hash, which should be the same even with a custom cache instance.\n\n\n## [v10.3.20](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.3.20) (2024-03-04)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Move selected item when scrolling via keyboard in Select ([#2609](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2609)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v10.3.19](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.3.19) (2024-03-01)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(button): Fix icon colors in buttons and SegmentedControl ([#2623](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2623)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  This change may trigger a visual regression with certain icons in buttons and `SegmentedControl` buttons.

([#2379](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2379)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  This fix adds Emotion's `CacheProvider` to the `CanvasProvider`. Any application that uses the `CacheProvider` will not see this fix within the render tree of the custom `CacheProvider`.  For this fix to be applied everywhere, consider removing any use of Emotion's `CacheProvider`.\n  \n  Some instances of use of `CacheProvider` were to set the `compat` mode of the cache. You can now do the following instead and not use `CacheProvider` at all:\n  \n  ```ts\n  cache.compat = true\n  ```\n  \n  Also note this fix will break automatic server side rendering because style merging is not creating server-side only `style` tags. Since `createStyles` isn't compatible with automatic server side rendering, the merge style fix isn't compatible either. Use Emotion's solution for server-side `@emotion/css`: https://emotion.sh/docs/ssr#when-using-emotioncss\n  \n  The only modification is to import `cache` from `@emotion/css` instead of creating a new cache. Their documentation doesn't work:\n  \n  ```patch\n  - import createCache from '@emotion/cache'\n  - \n  - const key = 'custom'\n  - const cache = createCache({ key })\n  + import {cache} from '@emotion/css';\n  + const {key} = cache\n  ```\n\n\n## [v10.0.5](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.0.5) (2023-11-09)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- docs: Update README ([#2369](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2369)) ([@aditya7302](https://github.com/aditya7302))\n\n\n## [v10.0.4](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.0.4) (2023-11-08)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(select): Fix circular import statement ([#2386](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2386)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v10.0.3](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.0.3) (2023-11-03)\n\n\n\n\n## [v10.0.2](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.0.2) (2023-10-31)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Pass colors prop to basebutton and button ([#2381](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2381)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n\n## [v10.0.1](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.0.1) (2023-10-30)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- chore: Update Canvas dependencies ([#2377](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2377)) ([@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith))\n\n\n## [v10.0.0](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v10.0.0) (2023-10-25)\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n- [#2229](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2229) There is the possibility of breaking changes if users are changing the default browser font size from `16px` to another value. \n  \n  You can convert a `px` value to a `rem` value by dividing your `px` value by `16`(if your default browser font size hasn't been updated, the value will be `16`).\n  \n  For example:\n  \n  | Equation    | rem Value |\n  | ----------- | --------- |\n  | `16px/16px` | `1rem`    |\n  | `32px/16px` | `2rem`    |\n  | `8px/16px`  | `0.5rem`  |\n- [#2247](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2247) To move from the Menu component in Preview to the Menu compound component in Main, please read [this discussion](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/2063).\n  \n  Also, see [this](https://codesandbox.io/s/deprecatedmenu-and-menu-migration-gwi1ov) codesandbox that shows the differences between DeprecatedMenu and the Menu compound component.\n- [#2318](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2318) We have removed the useBanner hook, the only function of which was to add `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` references to the text inside of the Banner. This was not required for accessibility, and browsers can compute the `name` of the Banner from the text given inside.\n- [#2285](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2285) - We refactored how we styled Buttons to use our `createStyles` utility function. We don't anticipate\n  this as a breaking change but, there may be slight changes to visual test.\n  - Icons will no longer be \"filled\" on toggle. This decision was made to not have the existing icon\n  look different in the toggled state from default state.\n  - `PrimaryButton`: On the `inverse` variant, the focus ring is now consistent with the default variant of `PrimaryButton`. This will visually change the `inverse` variant to have a larger appearance when focused. \n  - `colors` will no longer support the `focusRing` option:\n    ```tsx\n    import {focusRing} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';\n  \n    // before\n    <PrimaryButton\n      colors={{\n        // other colors\n        focus: {\n          // other colors\n        focusRing: focusRing(/* options */)\n        }\n      }}\n    />\n  \n    // after\n    <PrimaryButton\n      colors={{\n        // other colors\n        focus: {\n          // other colors\n        }\n      }}\n      css={{\n        ':focus-visible': focusRing(/* options */)\n      }}\n    />;\n    ```\n- [#2309](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2309) - We've converted `Select` in Main into a compound component. This component matches our pattern of providing access to lower-level elements and allows for more flexibility. \n  - The spacing between menu and its target element will increase from 0px to 4px\n  - We've also [deprecated](https://canvas.workday.com/getting-started/canvas-glossary#deprecation) the `Select` in Preview. You may still consume this component but suggest migrating over to the one in Main.\n- [#2368](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2368) The CSS kit is being removed in v10 and will come back later as derived from our React packages.\n\n### Codemods\n\n- feat: Set initial v10 codemod ([#2239](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2239)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n\n### Components\n\n- feat: Update space and depth tokens to rem ([#2229](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2229)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell), [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith), [@bstanton678](https://github.com/bstanton678), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n  Updated `depth` and `space` token values to use `rem` instead of `px`.\n- feat: Remove Menu Preview ([#2247](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2247)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  This will not involve a codemod since the API has too many differences between the component being removed in Preview and the component in Main.\n- fix: Changing ARIA role to switch ([#2292](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2292)) ([@williamjstanton](https://github.com/williamjstanton), [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith))\n- refactor: Removing aria attributes from Banner component ([#2318](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2318)) ([@williamjstanton](https://github.com/williamjstanton), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n- fix: Revert removal of Menu in Preview ([#2335](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2335)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n  We're going to continue supporting the Menu in Preview until we implement grouped menu items (with virtualization) for the Menu in Main.\n- feat: Deprecate InputIconContainer ([#2332](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2332)) ([@dgubko](https://github.com/dgubko), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n  `InputIconContainer` has been deprecated, because it does not handle bidirectionally or icons at the start of an input.

Please replace the deprecated `Drawer` component with `SidePanel` from the Preview package.\n- [#1978](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1978) If you expected a button to submit by default, you'll have to add the attribute `type=\"submit\"` in order to submit.\n- [#2018](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2018) We have hard deprecated the Layout and Column components and they have been fully removed from our codebase in v9. We recommend using the `Grid` component as an alternative.\n- [#2012](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2012) We've hard deprecated the `Stack`, `HStack` and `VStack` components. We recommend using the `Flex` component as a replacement and replacing the `spacing` prop with the `gap` prop. You can also run `npx @workday/canvas-kit-codemod softDeprecate/Stack` as well.\n- [#2034](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2034) - Lodash is no longer required for Canvas kit\n  - memoized is removed from FocusRingOptions\n- [#2044](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2044) If you're using Toast from Labs already, the package will be updated to point to `@workday/canvas-kit-react/toast`. If you're using the Toast from Main, we've replaced it with the compound Toast from labs. `v9` codemod should handle these changes for you or you can reference our v9 upgrade guide for more details.\n- [#2120](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2120) - We've removed `getCanvasTheme` and `useCanvasTheme`.\n  - Use `useTheme` when you have a `CanvasProvider` or you're inside of a functional component\n  - Use `getTheme` when inside a styled component and you need access to theme.\n- [#2180](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2180) - Removed `composeModelHooks` from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/common`\n- [#2190](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2190) The type signature of `composeHooks` was changed to give more accurate return prop types. This may cause issues with Typescript if your code expected the incorrect return types.\n- [#2194](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2194) The signature of the `NavigationManaget` and `NavigationRequestor` was changed to use numeric indexes instead of string identifiers. This will only break for those who created a custom navigation manager.\n\n### Codemod\n\n- test: Update Toast codemod to transform before promote ([#2125](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2125)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n\n### Codemods\n\n- fix: Stack Codemod Fix ([#2127](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2127)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n\n### Components\n\n- chore: Hard deprecate Drawer component ([#1970](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1970)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- fix: Update button type for all canvas kit buttons ([#1978](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1978)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n  We've changed the default button type for all of our buttons from `submit` to `button`\n- chore: Hard deprecate Layout and Column components ([#2018](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2018)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n- feat: Remove Stack, HStack and VStack ([#2012](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2012)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n- feat: Promote labs Toast to Main ([#2044](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2044)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n  We've promoted Toast from labs to the main package.

([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- feat: Tables Component ([#2118](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2118)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n  We've built a new `Table` compound component that will have more flexibility and has access to lower level components like

([#2182](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2182)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  `InputGroup` will replace `InputIconContainer`. `InputIconContainer` does not handle

([#2135](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2135)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  We're updating our build target from `es5` to `es2019`. This changes the syntax generated by allowing syntax supported up to `es2019`. This may impact older environments that do not support `es2019` syntax like older versions of nodejs. This could also impact older AST build parsers that don't understand newer JavasScript syntax. This could include old versions of Webpack or outdated babel parsers for Jest. If you see a message like \"Syntax Error\", you may have to upgrade your bundler or babel parser.\n- chore: Add option to skip docgen ([#2176](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2176)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n### Tokens\n\n- fix: Modify depth values to improve visual design ([#2091](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2091)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n  We've updated our `depth` tokens to be more subtle rather than harsh. Any component using these depth tokens will be updated, including `Card, Menu, Toast, Box, Dialog, Popup`.\n\n### Utilities\n\n- chore: Move useThemedRing to main package and deprecate useThemeRTL ([#2119](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2119)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera)\n  - We've promoted `useThemedRing` to our Main package.\n  - We've deprecated `useThemeRTL` from our Labs package. You may still use this utility but we encourage consumers to use [CSS logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties).\n\n\n## [v8.6.5](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v8.6.5) (2023-05-10)\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n- chore: Add actions for major release ([#2211](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2211)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose), [@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n\n\n## [v8.6.4](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v8.6.4) (2023-05-01)\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n- [#2173](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2173) Optional breaking changes message. If your PR includes breaking changes. It is extremely rare to put breaking changes outside a `prerelease/major` branch. Anything in this section will show up in release notes. Remove this section if no breaking changes are present.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- fix: Basic Grid Example with landmark regions for screen readers ([#2173](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/2173)) ([@bstanton678](https://github.com/bstanton678))\n  Optional release note message. Changelog and release summaries will contain a pull request title. This section will add additional notes under that title.

[#1636](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1636) Canvas Kit will require teams to be on version ^18.x or at least ^17.0 for backwards compatibility. To use have all React 18 features would require teams to upgrade root API, otherwise they will be ignored.\n- [#1646](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1646) Some component will now have to be imported like this: `import { export1 } from \"module-name\";`\n  \n  * chore: Bump csstype to v3 and update style prop types (#1673)\n  \n  We removed csstype in [a previous update](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/commit/026b66731361064192c405e99eb0e1412c7dd09f#diff-3be175031a0046a5ad6ec23a2bfdea7e7d8e996dc4e6846a8f8d885ddc4b0edeL57), but we need to add it back.

Now overflow functionality is provided by List system and requires to switch to `BreadcrumbsModel` manually.\n- [#1785](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1785) We've removed any IE11 specific code including any polyfills. This means your application will no longer run in IE11 and fail to bootstrap with an error and a white screen. Do not upgrade to this version if your application needs to support IE11.\n- [#1800](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1800) - `ComponentStatesTable`, `permutateProps`, `StaticStates` and `propTypes` have been moved to `@workday/canvas-kit-react/testing`. \n  - `StaticStates` and `convertToStaticStates` have been moved from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/common` to `@workday/canvas-kit-react/testing`\n  🤖 All the above changes can be handled by running codemod\n- [#1863](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1863) Optional breaking changes message. If your PR includes breaking changes. It is extremely rare to put breaking changes outside a `prerelease/major` branch. Anything in this section will show up in release notes. Remove this section if no breaking changes are present.\n- [#1861](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1861) We've updated all popup `CloseIcon` and `CloseButton` to default to `type=button`. We did this so\n  these close buttons did not submit the forms unintentionally. Without this change, you have to\n  manually add `type=\"button\"` to these components if you wrap popup contents in a `form` element.\n  While this is a very unlikely that a `CloseButton` was intentionally used as an implicit submit\n  button, it is still a breaking change. This change effects the following components:\n  \n  - `Popup.CloseIcon`\n  - `Dialog.CloseIcon`\n  - `Modal.CloseIcon`\n  - `Popup.CloseButton`\n  - `Dialog.CloseButton`\n  - `Modal.CloseButton`\n- [#1874](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1874) `ActionBar.OverflowButton` inside `ActionBar.List` is replaced with an `overflowButton` prop. So, now `ActionBar.List` with overflow behavior requires to pass an overflow button component as a `overflowButton` prop. \n  \n  ```tsx\n  <ActionBar.List overflowButton={<ActionBar.OverflowButton aria-label=\"More actions\" />} />\n  ```\n  \n  🤖 This change can be handled by using codemod.\n- [#1880](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1880) The `LoadingAnimation` component has been renamed to `LoadingDots` and its slash import is now `@workday/canvas-kit-react/loading-dots` instead of `@workday/canvas-kit-react/loading-animation`.\n\n### Components\n\n- fix: Remove default imports from components ([#1634](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1634)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n  We've updated some of our components to remove default exports.

This will close the popup when less than 50% of the target element is visible. This hook uses an [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).\n- feat: Add new compound status indicator ([#1851](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1851)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4), manuel.carrera, [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll), [@jamesfan](https://github.com/jamesfan), [@willklein](https://github.com/willklein))\n  We've created a compound component version of our `StatusIndicator` which you can find under our `preview` components. This new API will allow for more composability and ergonomic API.

[#1359](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1359) This change updates the banner component to use the compound component pattern. For more information, please see the V7 migration guide.\n- [#1396](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1396) Change `fixed` prop from component to `position` to set container position (`fixed` position has been set as default).\n- [#1329](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1329) Status Indicators currently truncate when they reach their max width of `150px`. After receiving\n  requests to increase this, we have upped it by 25% to `200px`.\n- [#1409](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1409) Canvas Kit will require teams to be on version ^17.x or at least 16.14 for backwards compatibility and we will remove the jsx pragma and use of css props. This does not mean consumers can’t use the css prop, just that internally we will stop using it. This would require teams to upgrade other parts of their app  including  React, potentially Babel and any other side effects that come with it.\n- [#1442](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1442) All findings and changes have been outlines [here](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/discussions/1453)\n- [#1456](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1456) We are hard deprecating `CookieBanner`, `Header` and `PageHeader`. If you would like to migrate off of these components you can find them under our [Example](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/story/examples-cookiebanner-react--basic) section in storybook\n- [#1460](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1460) Flex, Box and Stack will no longer be imported from `@workday/canvas-kit-labs-react`. They will now be imported from `@workday/canvas-kit-react/layout`\n- [#1477](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1477) -  Combined Icon Buttons with Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary buttons\n  - Remove IconButton component\n  -  Add a new XS, L sizes\n  -  Removed the `toggled` prop when migrating over Icon Buttons\n  - Converted `SegmentedControl` into a compound component and it no longer renders `IconButton` as children\n  - Changed the values of `IconPosition`: `left` | `right` - > `start` | `end`\n  - Refactored `AccentIcon`, `AppletIcon`, `Graphic`, `Icon`, `Svg`, `SystemIcon`, and `SystemIconCircle` to use create component and remove `iconRef` prop and now just pass the ref forward\n  - Remove `dataLabel` prop from `PrimaryButton` and `SecondaryButton`\n- [#1547](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1547) - Upgrade Typescript to 4.1 and drop support for Typescript <4\n  - `Popup.Body` is an overflow container. If your popup buttons are inside the `Popup.Body` element (our examples did this), you will need to move those buttons outside the `Popup.Body` element, otherwise the focus rings may be cut off. See migration guide for more information.\n  - Changed the signature of model callbacks and guards. This is handled by our codemod\n    - Before:\n      - `shouldUpdate({data, state})`\n      - `onUpdate({data, prevState})`\n    - After:\n      - `shouldUpdate(data, state)`\n      - `onUpdate(data, prevState)`\n- [#1587](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1587) Removed the data wrapper around the `event` in `show` and `hide` events. The arguments are not commonly used, however.\n  \n  ```tsx\n  // v6\n  const model = usePopupModel({\n    onShow({ data: { event }, prevState }) {\n      console.log(event);\n    }\n  })\n  \n  // v7\n  const model = usePopupModel({\n    onShow(event, prevState) {\n      console.log(event);\n    }\n  })\n  ```\n  \n  🤖 The codemod will update all inline guards and callbacks like in this example. If a guard or\n  callback was defined outside the model config block, it will not be covered by the codemod.\n- [#1585](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1585) This PR contains breaking changes because using new ActionBar requires restructure old version and adding ActionBar.List as sub-component of ActionBar. This changes are covered by codemod but using an overflow behavior requires manual implementation.\n\n### Codemods\n\n- fix(codemod): Add JSXExpressionContainer support to V7 IconButton codemod ([#1558](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1558)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n\n### Components\n\n- refactor(banner): Update Banner to use the compound component pattern ([#1359](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1359)) ([@vibdev](https://github.com/vibdev))\n- fix(side-panel): Add tooltip to toggle button for side panel ([#1401](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1401)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- feat(action-bar): Refactor ActionBar component ([#1396](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1396)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n- feat: Increase max width of Status Indicator, add prop and examples ([#1329](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1329)) ([@anicholls](https://github.com/anicholls))\n- feat(modal): Add support for scrolling a modal ([#1259](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1259)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- chore!: Hard deprecate Header, Page Header and Cookie Banner  ([#1456](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1456)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- chore: Migrate Flex, Stack and Box to main under layout  ([#1460](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1460)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- fix(modal): Remove x axis scrollbar ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- fix(modal): Correct overflow value ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- fix(modal): Update Modal full-overflow for IE11 ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- chore: Combine Icon Buttons with Primary, Secondary and Tertiary ([#1477](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1477)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- feat(common): Update depth tokens ([#1517](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1517)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n- fix(button): Update padding for buttons ([#1532](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1532)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- fix(popup): Remove containerElement prop from Popper ([#1524](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1524)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n- fix(toast): Add aria attributes to alert toast ([#1536](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1536)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n- fix(button): Updated stories to match spec ([#1539](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1539)) ([@josh-bagwell](https://github.com/josh-bagwell))\n- feat(select): Accept custom render method prop for selected option ([#1512](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1512)) ([@giulialubet](https://github.com/giulialubet))\n- chore: Update accent, applet, and system icon deps ([#1554](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1554)) ([@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith))\n- fix: Update codemod to run all transforms ([#1563](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1563)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- feat: Add collection system ([#1547](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1547)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  We've added a collection system to help our users create custom components like\n- fix(layout): Update reentrant imports for layout components ([#1574](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1574)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- feat(preview): Add Pill component ([#1542](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1542)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n  We've added a new Pill component.

unique id generation ([#1408](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1408)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  **NOTE for jest snapshots**: This change removes the `uuid` package and instead will generate a one-time client seed and then create auto-incrementing ids. This change will not break UI or automated UI tests. It will break snapshot tests however. Previously, the only way to get stable ids for snapshot tests was to mock the `uuid` module. This was an implementation detail. To make snapshots work again, add the following to your jest setup file:\n\n  ```ts\n  import {setUniqueSeed, resetUniqueIdCount} from '@workday/canvas-kit-react/common';\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    setUniqueSeed('a'); // force set the seed\n    resetUniqueIdCount(); // reset the unique id count\n  });\n  ```\n\n  This will ensure each Jest snapshot has ids that look like `a0` and `a1` and will be the same every time the snapshot is run. Do not use these methods in production though - it may lead to inaccessible applications due to IDREF collisions.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n- ci: Fix scripts ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- ci: Fix build script calls ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## [v6.2.3](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.2.3) (2022-01-13)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(side-panel): Remove console.log ([#1417](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1417)) ([@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith))\n\n\n## [v6.2.2](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.2.2) (2022-01-10)\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n- chore: Pin colors to version 1.4.0 ([#1411](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1411)) ([@Parker-Ledoux](https://github.com/Parker-Ledoux))\n\n\n## [v6.2.1](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.2.1) (2022-01-07)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(search-form): Remove default autocomplete ([#1407](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1407)) ([@sheenasi](https://github.com/sheenasi))\n\n\n## [v6.2.0](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.2.0) (2022-01-03)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(popup-stack): Add support for the fullscreen API ([#1403](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1403)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  Fullscreen support was added to all Popups. 3 new hooks were added to help support fullscreen in whatever way you see fit:\n  - `useTransferOnFullscreenEnter`: Use if your popup should remain open and be transfer into the fullscreen element\n  - `useTransferOnFullscreenExit`: Use if your popup should remain open and transfer out of the fullscreen element back to the body element\n  - `useCloseOnFullscreenExit`: Use if your popup should close when fullscreen is exited\n- chore: Add screenful to lockfile ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## [v5.3.7](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v5.3.7) (2022-01-03)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(popup-stack): Add support for the fullscreen API ([#1403](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1403)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  Fullscreen support was added to all Popups. 3 new hooks were added to help support fullscreen in whatever way you see fit:\n  - `useTransferOnFullscreenEnter`: Use if your popup should remain open and be transfer into the fullscreen element\n  - `useTransferOnFullscreenExit`: Use if your popup should remain open and transfer out of the fullscreen element back to the body element\n  - `useCloseOnFullscreenExit`: Use if your popup should close when fullscreen is exited\n\n## [v6.1.5](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.1.5) (2021-12-22)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- docs: Add CookieBanner example ([#1402](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1402)) ([@RayRedGoose](https://github.com/RayRedGoose))\n\n\n## [v6.1.4](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.1.4) (2021-12-17)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- docs: Add ExtractProps to the v5 migration guide ([#1397](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1397)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## [v5.3.6](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v5.3.6) (2021-12-17)\n\n### Components\n\n- chore: Bump uuid to stable non deprecated version ([#1367](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1367)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n\n### Documentation\n\n- docs: Add ExtractProps to the v5 migration guide ([#1397](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1397)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n### Revert\n\n- fix: Revert uuid upgrade to get releases working ([#1371](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1371)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n## [v6.1.3](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.1.3) (2021-12-17)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(tabs): Fix Dynamic Tabs example ([#1398](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1398)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## [v6.1.2](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.1.2) (2021-12-14)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(tabs): Remove gutter from tabs overflow menu ([#1378](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1378)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n\n\n## [v6.1.1](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/releases/tag/v6.1.1) (2021-12-10)\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n- chore: Have verify action to wait on visual tests ([#1385](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1385)) ([@mannycarrera4](https://github.com/mannycarrera4))\n- chore: Remove unused and uneeded dependencies ([#1388](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1388)) ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n  - Storybook knobs are removed and all stories use [Storybook Controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls) instead.

All patches will be automatically released. In order to accomplish this, a new pull request link job is run to make sure that all features target a prerelease branch. For example, if you create a new pull request that adds a feature and the current version of Canvas Kit is `v5.2.0`, the target branch should be `prerelease/minor` instead of `master`. Don't worry, the pull request lint job will prevent mistakes. Also the Canvas Kit team can help by changing the base branch of your pull requests.\n- ci: Add npm debug information ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- ci: Fix npm publish for release ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- ci: Fix npm token ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- ci: Fix npm publish ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- ci: Fix build process ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n- ci: Fix push GH token ([@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll))\n\n\n## v5.2.0 (2021-09-08)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(toast): Update to properly render rtl ([#1229](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1229)) [@JaredWF](https://github.com/JaredWF)\n- fix: Update search bar to properly render rtl ([#1231](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1231)) [@JaredWF](https://github.com/JaredWF)\n- fix(side-panel): Fix SidePanel RTL support ([#1234](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1234)) [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith)\n- feat(icon): Add shouldMirror prop to icons ([#1246](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1246)) [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith)\n\n### Hooks\n\n- feat(labs): Add convertToStaticStates to useThemeRTL ([#1216](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1216)) [@vibdev](https://github.com/vibdev)\n\n### Docs\n\n- docs: Update inter-linking to match Canvas Site ([#1220](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1220)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)\n- docs: Update SidePanel docs to MDX ([#1236](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1236)) [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith)\n- docs: Update various issues prevent docs mdx files from being rendered remotely ([#1238](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1238)) [@anicholls](https://github.com/anicholls)\n- docs: Improve Variant/Type/State docs ([#1243](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1243)) [@anicholls](https://github.com/anicholls)\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n- chore: Bump path-parse from 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 ([#1211](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1211)) [@dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot)\n- ci: Add Chromatic baseline to support branches ([#1219](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1219)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)\n- fix: Fix create-component README template ([#1235](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1235)) [@alanbsmith](https://github.com/alanbsmith)\n- chore(table): Update polished package to fix security warning ([#1242](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1242)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)\n\n## v5.1.0 (2021-08-16)\n\n### Components\n\n- fix(form-field): Updates legend to be direct child of FieldSet ([#1146](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1146)) [@sahlhoff](https://github.com/sahlhoff)\n- fix(popup): Fix RTL rendering for popups ([#1183](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1183)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)\n- fix(combobox): Add type attribute and remove tabindex attribute ([#1172](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1172)) [@vibdev](https://github.com/vibdev)\n- test(popup): Add visual tests for RTL in Modal and Popup ([#1159](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1159)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)\n- fix(menu): Fix Menu item icon colors ([#1157](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1157)) [@sahlhoff](https://github.com/sahlhoff)\n- fix: Fix changeFocus to take any input and Dialog/Modal to accept model config ([#1154](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1154)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)\n\n### Hooks & Utils\n\n- fix(common): Remove @ts-ignore from ExtractProps ([#1189](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1189)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)\n- feat(common): Add useThemeRTL hook ([#1041](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1041)) [@vibdev](https://github.com/vibdev)\n\n### Docs\n\n- fix(menu): Update readme to show correct import for menu item ([#1208](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/1208)) [@karapalumbo](https://github.com/karapalumbo)\n- docs: Fix prop tables.

logic ([#752](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/752)) [@donovangini](https://github.com/donovangini)\n\n### Breaking Changes:\n- feat(popup-stack): Add adapter API to integrate with other popup systems ([#782](https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit/pull/782)) [@NicholasBoll](https://github.com/NicholasBoll)\n\nThis is a potentially breaking  change if you use `usePopupStack` and `ReactDOM.createPortal(contents, document.body)`:\nWe added `createContainer` to `PopupStack`. React no longer controls the element that is given to the the `PopupStack`. The `PopupStack` will now create a containing element that your content should render into. If you recognize this pattern, you'll need to render into `stackRef.current` instead of `document.body`.\n\nBefore:\n```tsx\nconst ref = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);\n\nusePopupStack(ref)\n\nReact.createPortal(contents, document.body)\n```\n\nNow\n```tsx\nconst stackRef = usePopupStack()\n\nReact.createPortal(contents, stackRef.current)\n```\n\n## 4.0.1 (2020-07-08)\n\n### Components\n- fix(combobox): Add explicit arg to initEvent in ComboBox and header SearchBar
