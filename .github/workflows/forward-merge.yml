            This pull request was automatically created by an automated [forward-merge job](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}). The automated job failed automated checks and must be resolved manually.
            Reasons for failure may include:
            - Merge conflicts that cannot be automatically resolved
            - A merge resulted in check failures
              - Lint or type errors
              - Test failures
              - Unexpected visual changes
            The pull request should inform you of merge conflicts before you start if any.
            1. Run the following commands in your terminal. If this succeeds, skip step 2. The last command will run a script that tries to merge and resolve conflicts automatically.
                ```
                git branch -D merge/${{needs.get-branch-names.outputs.branch}}-into-${{ needs.get-branch-names.outputs.next-branch }} || true
                git fetch upstream
                git checkout --track upstream/merge/${{needs.get-branch-names.outputs.branch}}-into-${{ needs.get-branch-names.outputs.next-branch }}
                git pull upstream merge/${{needs.get-branch-names.outputs.branch}}-into-${{ needs.get-branch-names.outputs.next-branch }} -f
                git pull upstream ${{needs.get-branch-names.outputs.branch}}
                node utils/forward-merge.js
                ```
            2. If the previous step succeeded, skip to step 4.
            3. Resolve conflicts manually. Then run the following.
                ```
                git add .
                git commit -m "chore: Merge ${{needs.get-branch-names.outputs.branch}} into ${{ needs.get-branch-names.outputs.next-branch }}"
                ```
            4. Push the merge commit back to the pull request
                ```
                git push upstream merge/${{needs.get-branch-names.outputs.branch}}-into-${{ needs.get-branch-names.outputs.next-branch }}
                ```
            If there were no merge conflicts, the forward-merge job failed because of a test failure. You can wait for the pull request to give errors, or you can check the logs for failures. You'll have to update code to fix errors.
            This pull request will be merged using the `merge` strategy instead of the `squash` strategy. This means any commit in the log will show in the branch's history. Any commit you make should amend the merge commit. Use the following command:
            ```
            git commit --amend --no-edit
            ```
            You must then force-push the branch and the CI will rerun verification.
            Use the `automerge` label like normal and the CI will pick the correct merge strategy.
